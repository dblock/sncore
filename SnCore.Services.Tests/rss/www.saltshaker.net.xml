    <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&nbsp;The potato takes little care of lung and heart. It reaches the head, but only, as I said, the lower head, not the upper head. It does go into the lower head, where one thinks and exercises critical faculties. Therefore, you can see, in earlier times there were fewer journalists. There was no printing industry yet. Think of the amount of thought expended daily in this world in our time, just to bring the newspapers out! All that thinking, it is much too much, it is not at all necessary — and we have to thank the potato diet for that! Because a person who eats potatoes is constantly stimulated to think. He can&#8217;t do anything but think. That&#8217;s why his lungs and his heart become weak. Tuberculosis, lung tuberculosis, did not become widespread until the potato diet was introduced. And the weakest human beings are those living in regions where almost nothing else is grown but potatoes, where the people live on potatoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Rudolf Steiner, philosopher</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>There are those restaurants that everyone knows about, recommends, and no one writes anything new about. These are the sorts of places that show up in every guidebook, piece of hyperinflated promotional fluff, or casual mention - just because&#8230; everyone knows about them. Several in town come to mind - and perhaps I&#8217;ll eventually get to them all, but I may as well start with <strong>La Cabrera Norte</strong>, Cabrera 5127 in Palermo, 4832-5754, which is ever so slightly north, though perhaps more west, of La Cabrera <em>sans</em> more than that. And what does everyone talk about when it comes to La Cabrera? The side dishes. Oh, the steaks too, which, in a beef-centric culture like this are quite good as well. In fact, they&#8217;re better than quite good - I&#8217;d put the steaks at La Cabrera up there among the better ones in the city, and as you can see in the photo below, there was no wanting of forks to dig into them.</p>
<p>I was out last Sunday with a group of master sommeliers who&#8217;d flown in for a tour and series of seminars out in the vineyards of Mendoza, but they were spending a couple of days seeing Buenos Aires, dining out, and generally having a good time. Knowing a couple of them, and the person who organized the tour, I got myself attached to the group for the day, which is not only great fun when the people are (and anyone who knows sommeliers that have been around for awhile knows they know how to have a good time), but gets me a chance to pop in on places that I don&#8217;t frequent all that often. So here we were, eight MS&#8217;s, myself, and the PR person who&#8217;d put it altogether, and they shove the menus in my hands and say, &#8220;Choose stuff we&#8217;ll like.&#8221; No pressure, you know?</p>
<p>We had to give them a bit of the usual suspects and a bit of the off the wall stuff - so a round of chorizos, morcillas, chinchulines (the latter two - blood sausage and grilled intestines), and the weirdest looking provoletas I think I&#8217;ve ever seen - no, that&#8217;s not a sea monster crawling out of the ooze&#8230;.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/lacabreranorteprovoleta.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="La Cabrera Norte - provoleta liquida" /></center></p>
<p>Then on to a couple of mounded salads, followed by a trio of steaks - entra&ntilde;a, bife de chorizo, ojo de bife (respectively, skirt steak, loin steak, rib-eye) - which, at La Cabrera Norte (and the non-norte spot as well), are simply huge - ten of us couldn&#8217;t finish the three steaks. So, while the menu can look pricey at first glance, given than each steak can easily feed 2-4 people, depending, you know?, it&#8217;s not really.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/lacabreranortesteaks.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="La Cabrera Norte - steaks" /></center></p>
<p>Now, the side dishes are not so much side dishes as little ramekins of stuff - starchy stuff. Each steak comes with a half dozen (not the dozens and dozens that most folk seem to hype) little ramekins - potatoes in mayonnaise, roasted potatoes, potatoes in some sort of eggy dressing, hearts of palm in mayonnaise, chambota (onions and peppers in oil), and lentils, all served room temp - each of which is a few forkfuls - which is not to disparage them, it&#8217;s plenty of food - but we&#8217;re not exactly talking about some sort of amazing accompaniments to the steaks. They&#8217;re good, but that&#8217;s about as far as I&#8217;d go. There&#8217;s also the ubiquitous chimichurri and salsa criolla, though the latter is served pureed, which is flavorful, but not my style. Personally, I&#8217;m more for just going for the steaks - the entra&ntilde;a is really excellent - and ordering another provoleta, and cholesterol be damned for one day every now and again. The french fries, which of course we needed to order, are simply okay - nothing special, and perhaps a little overdone and greasy. Plus they have this very strange dish called <em>papas fritas criollas</em>, which are basically french fries topped with a mess of soft scrambled eggs (which, no, don&#8217;t come with side dishes, we just set the bowl on the empty platter from one of the steaks). Odd, just odd, but the group wanted to try them - personally I like the <em>provencal</em>, with garlic and parsley, but hey, this was something different&#8230;.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/lacabreranortepapascriollas.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="La Cabrera Norte - papas criollas" /></center></p>
<p>Overall, La Cabrera Norte gets high marks for food. The ambiance is a bit boisterous, and the place tends to be packed, at alot of times, with tourists (Sunday afternoon I could hear enough English being spoken around the place to think I was back in Manhattan) - and the waiters all cater to that crowd. It&#8217;s not that you won&#8217;t find locals there, but more likely early on in the week in the late evenings&#8230;.</p>

    <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&nbsp;French speaking countries in Africa have always enjoyed a special relationship with their former colonial master. French influence in those countries remained strong even after independence, with currencies tied by a fixed exchange rate to the French franc, military agreements allowing the stationing of French intervention forces in Africa, and a strong presence of French companies in Francophone territories.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Emmanuel Wongibe, editor, Radio Deutshe Weller International</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>Fifty years have passed since the fall of French Equatorial Africa, splitting apart into separate states, tossing off the yoke of French colonial masters. Likewise in the neighboring Congo, and not far away in western Africa, in Mauritania. It seemed as good a moment as any to explore the flavors that spring from the combination of African tradition with French colonial cuisine.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/081128troutmilletcake.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Trout and Millet Cakes" /></center></p>
<p>Starting off in the nation of Chad, two key ingredients struck my fancy - dried smoked trout, as a way of preserving them, and millet, a cereal grain that one rarely sees used outside of vegan cooking. In fact, several people I mentioned it to seemed to think it was only for use as bird feed, but no, millet is actually quite nutritious and delicious! I decided to go with fresh trout and millet, and make something approximating a crab cake. First I cooked the millet - a quick and easy boiling process, taking no more than about 10-15 minutes. I let it cool and then mixed it with chopped fresh trout, onion and red bell peppers, minced garlic and basil, a little hot paprika, lemon juice, smoked salt, pepper, and some beaten egg. All mixed together well, then formed into patties, rolled in breadcrumbs, and left to sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to firm up a little. I fried them in a mix of butter and oil, served them with a salad of frisee and arugula tossed with just a little olive oil, and on the side, a spicy sauce made of green tea, tahini, ginger, soy sauce, lemon juice, molasses, and ground habanero pepper.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/081128cucumbersoup.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Chilled Cucumber Mint Soup" /></center></p>
<p>Moving on to Gabon, and starting with the idea of a simple salad, I gather made of little more than crushed or grated cucumber with chilies, garlic and vinegar. As usual, we like to offer up a soup, and with recent hot weather, a cold cucumber soup sounded like a good move. Into the blender went peeled cucumbers, ginger, garlic, lots of mint leaves, and a very small chili pepper. I pureed that, added &#8220;half-and-half&#8221; here that means adding equal parts of milk and cream, seasoned to taste with salt and white pepper, and served it simply topped with chopped green onions.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/081128duckleg.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Braised Duck Legs in Tomato Peanut Sauce" /></center></p>
<p>While the judges on <em>Top Chef</em> last season may have poo-pooed the idea of combining tomatoes and peanuts in a sauce, I have to assert it was just the particular dish they were dealing with. African cuisine abounds with dishes that use both, from soups to stews to sauces. Starting from a traditional dish of the Congo that uses chicken stewed slowly in just such a combination, I decided to up the ante slightly and use duck. I separated duck legs into their two sections, browned them with some onions in a little oil, then covered them with water, covered the pot, and let them simmer away over low heat for just over an hour. I removed the legs to one side, and into the pot went some white wine, plenty of cayenne pepper, about a cup of tomato paste and an equal amount of pure peanut butter, a little nutmeg and black pepper. Turning the heat up high, I cooked that all down until the sauce was reduced by about half, stirring regularly to make sure the peanut butter doesn&#8217;t lump together and burn. For service, the duck legs went back into the sauce, reheated to just a simmer. While traditionally served with <a href="http://www.saltshaker.net/20080302/roots-chapter-one" target="_blank">yuca root</a>, it&#8217;s out of season here, and what&#8217;s available is fibrous and/or rotting - so simple mashed potatoes on the side did the trick.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/081128coconutpepperbeef.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Coconut Pepper Beef" /></center></p>
<p>Mauritania has a quite different cuisine from the central African countries we&#8217;d started with. Having a more Arabic influence, and, in fact, that&#8217;s the major language of the country, as opposed to French in the other three, much of the food is reminiscent of dishes I&#8217;ve seen from Morocco. One, quite different, caught my eye - a beef dish stewed in coconut and mixed peppers. I decided on a style more like a traditional pepper steak - a ground together black pepper, allspice, coconut, and salt, and rubbed the beef with it. I left that to sit for several hours. In a dutch oven I sauteed tbin wedges of red onion in a mix of olive and dende (palm) oil, then added the beef and cooked to lightly brown. Topped up with a little water, I turned the heat down low and let the beef (rib-eye steak) braise for about 45 minutes until nice and tender. Removing the beef to the side, I thickened the remaining liquid with a <em>beurre mani&eacute;</em>, a paste of equal parts butter and flour (which helps stop the flour from clumping, and adds richness to the finished sauce), and served the beef, onions, and sauce over some blanched and then sauteed green beans.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/081128bananacake.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Banana Cake with Brown Sugar Cream" /></center></p>
<p>Finishing off, without a fifth country to explore (at least one that was celebrating 50 years of independence), I decided on a simple banana dessert. A sheetcake cut into triangles (1&frac34; pastry flour, 2&frac34; teaspoons baking powder, &#189; teaspoon salt, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup cream cheese, <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, &#189; teaspoon mace, &#189; teaspoon nutmeg, 2 eggs, 4 very ripe bananas - all whipped together and then baked in a hot oven until puffed and brown). Over and under the cake, a simple sauce made from boiling together &#189; cup cream cheese, &#189; cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar. A few kirsch marinated cherries rounded out the dish.</p>

<p>- Oscar Wilde, author</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="/wp-content/imagefromsingleguychef.jpg" width="180" height="260" align="right" hspace="4" alt="Photo of me from Cooking With The Single Guy" /><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>A couple of months ago I received a note from a charming young man in the San Francisco area who writes a blog called <em>Cooking With The Single Guy</em>. He wanted to reserve a spot at Casa SaltShaker, but in addition, wondered if he could come and spend the afternoon hanging out and chatting about food. While I work alone in the kitchen prepping for the dinners, it&#8217;s always nice to have some sort of auditory stimulation going on - when I&#8217;m on my own, the stereo in the living room gets cranked up to full volume so I can hear it in the kitchen - and a conversation is not only a different and welcome sort, but sometimes actually helps clarify what I&#8217;m doing in any given moment. So he popped by about six weeks ago and spent a couple of hours probing away at the origins of Casa S, my cooking career, and how I ended up here. He just <a href="http://singleguychef.blogspot.com/2008/12/home-cooking-conversation-with-daniel.html" target="_blank">published the interview on his blog</a> this morning - it&#8217;s definitely the <em>Reader&#8217;s Digest</em> version of the several hours we spent together, as expected, but I think he did a nice job of presenting the gist of what we talked about - so if you&#8217;ve been wondering how it all got started - a) you haven&#8217;t been reading my blog long enough, and b) you have a chance to get another viewpoint at it&#8230;.</p>

    <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&nbsp;Most turkeys taste better the day after, my mother’s tasted better the day before.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Rita Rudner, comedienne</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>Just to set your minds at ease, we did indeed celebrate Thanksgiving here. Not in Casa S, but we headed over to friends&#8217; in San Telmo for a turkey dinner with the fixin&#8217;s. While there&#8217;s no domestic turkey raising going on here in Argentina, or at least not at a commercial level, there is in Brazil, and frozen turkeys are brought in by the truckload around this time of year for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year&#8217;s holidays.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="/wp-content/tday2008carving.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Carving the turkey" /></p>
<p>Our master carver, and host, contemplates the 8 kilo (nearly 18 pound) turkey&#8230;.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/wp-content/tday2008table.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Gathered around the t-day table" /></p>
<p>A table full of good friends&#8230;.</p>
<p align="right"><img src="/wp-content/tday2008henry.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Stuffed Henry" /></p>
<p>And Henry, stuffed fuller than the turkey, after his first Thanksgiving feast.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/tday2008greenbeans.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Spicy Green Bean Salad" /></center></p>
<p>My part was a spicy green bean-ish salad that I based on the wonderful Gujurati green bean dish I made at our <a href="http://www.saltshaker.net/20080819/go-west-young-sahib" target="_blank">recent western Indian dinner</a>. It was too hot out to start thinking seriously about some sort of green bean casserole, and thank goodness there&#8217;s no Campbell&#8217;s Cream of Mushroom soup around anyway - though a can of those little fried onion rings wouldn&#8217;t be half bad&#8230;.</p>
<p>1 kilo green beans, topped and cut into segments<br />
1 kilo asparagus, peeled and cut into segments<br />
1 kilo potatoes, boiled, peeled, and cut in bite size pieces</p>
<p>Blanch the beans and asparagus until just softening, then drain and shock under cold water. </p>
<p>2 packets of peanut drink powder (this is the tough one, it&#8217;s a Thai drink mix that comes in a bag of little packets, it&#8217;s a mix of ground roasted peanuts and sugar - I find it in Chinatown - not that hard, you just have to make the trip&#8230;)<br />
&#189; cup of shredded coconut<br />
&#189; kilo smoked bacon, diced<br />
4-5 shallots, sliced thin<br />
&#188; cup of yellow mustard seeds (black are fine too with this recipe)<br />
4-5 jalapeños or other medium hot peppers, sliced thinly<br />
&#189; cup neutral oil<br />
salt</p>
<p>In a saute pan, start cooking the diced bacon over medium heat until it starts to brown. Add the oil and the mustard seeds and cook until they are popping away. Add the shallots and cook until limp. Add the rest of the ingredients and cook, stirring fairly steadily, until the coconut just starts to turn golden. Pour over the mixed vegetables, toss, let cool. Season with salt to taste.</p>
<p>Obviously, that makes a whole lot - you can cut the ingredient quantities down as need be. Bacon optional for those who want a vegetarian version, and adjust away on the hot peppers to make it either less or more spicy.</p>

    <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&nbsp;A creole language, or simply a creole, is a stable language that originates seemingly as a nativized pidgin&#8230;. While it is arguable that creoles share more grammatical similarities with each other than with the languages they phylogenetically derive from, no theory for explaining creole phenomena has been universally accepted. The relationship between pidgins and creoles and their similarities means that the distinction is not clear-cut and the variety of phenomena that arise to create pidgins and creoles are not understood very well. Likewise, efforts to articulate grammatical features (or sets of features) that are exclusive to creoles have been unsuccessful thus far.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>There are many sites out there, and more than enough people, who make fun of what tends to be called <em>chinglish</em> or <em>ingrish</em>, or something similar - reflecting the adoption of a new language by a culture, in those cases English by Chinese or Japanese usually, who don&#8217;t share a similar base of sounds, grammar, or speech style. Let&#8217;s just note that it&#8217;s not limited to the adaptation of English&#8230;. and if I spoke enough Mandarin, it&#8217;d be an interesting curiosity to see how our linguistic mistakes are viewed in China&#8230;. no?</p>

    <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&nbsp;What the hell do you think Leona really puts in that pizza?&#8221;</p>
<p>- Lili Taylor as JoJo in <em>Mystic Pizza</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>Those of you who&#8217;ve been reading awhile might remember the fiasco I considered the much lauded <a href="http://www.saltshaker.net/20071205/checkered-pass" target="_blank">Guido&#8217;s Bar</a> in Palermo. I know, I know, I hear regularly from people how amazing it is, how much food you get, how incredible the food, the atmosphere, the people. I don&#8217;t get it. From my perspective, anyone who likes a place like that probably loves hanging out in Little Italy in NYC, one of the biggest jokes on the &#8220;Italian&#8221; food eating public that&#8217;s ever been perpetrated. I have been back to Guido&#8217;s once more to see if it was simply an off-day - it wasn&#8217;t, the menu was virtually identical that we received, and without being asked for additional plates, we were cut off after simply receiving antipasti and a couple of mediocre pastas - asking for more didn&#8217;t elicit any scorn, and we received, once again, a small plate of meat to share, but for the price, we shouldn&#8217;t have had to ask, they should have been asking us. I standby my rip-off assessment.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/luckylucianopizza.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Lucky Luciano - pizza" /></center></p>
<p>Given that, I made no special plans to check out Carlos&#8217; son&#8217;s place around the corner, <a href="http://www.lucky-luciano.com.ar/" target="_blank"><strong>Lucky Luciano</strong></a>, Cervi&ntilde;o 3943, Palermo, 4802-1262. A shame, because, despite the fact that it was opened in order to handle the &#8220;overflow&#8221; from dad&#8217;s restaurant, the place offers a completely different menu of wood-oven fired pizzas and handmade pastas, at reasonable prices, that are well worth seeking out. The room is good sized, well-appointed if a little filled with knickknacks and such, there&#8217;s a large patio style garden with more tables in the back, and we settled ourselves under the twilight sky and ravenously ate our way through a half-and-half napolitana paired off against arugula with fresh tomatoes and shavings of parmesan.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/luckylucianopasta.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Lucky Luciano - spaghetti with grilled sausage and greens" /></center></p>
<p>We moved on to main courses, my companions both ordering the one meat dish on the menu, a veal saltimbocca that was fork tender and delicious, and my perfectly <em>al dente</em> spaghetti with smoky grilled sausage, chicory, and fontina cheese. The portions were good sized, the prices fair. The winelist is extensive and well-selected. They do have a slightly steep 30 peso a bottle corkage charge, but then, they&#8217;ve put alot of effort into an excellent wine cellar, and no doubt they&#8217;d prefer folk don&#8217;t bring wine as we did - we had a bottle of <a href="http://www.bodegachacra.com/pdf/chacra55_tech07.pdf" target="_blank">Bodega Chacra 55 Pinot Noir 2007</a> we&#8217;d wanted to try - a pricey one at nearly 300 pesos normally. Disappointing actually - light, fruity cherry and raspberry flavors with a little smoke and bramble on it - pretty much an average Pinot, and certainly not worth the price, other than to have just checked it off the list, so to speak.</p>
<p>Overall, recommended for a very nice evening!</p>

    <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&nbsp;He that but looketh on a plate of ham and eggs to lust after it hath already committed breakfast with it in his heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>- C.S. Lewis, author</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Buenos Aires - </strong>The subject of <em>shawarma</em> has come up numerous times recently, in casual conversation with aquaintances, in more in-depth chats with those closer, and seemingly in a multitude of visual sightings around the city. There&#8217;s been a running joke in Buenos Aires for several years now that when your restaurant is about to go under, start serving sushi - and all of the sudden you&#8217;ll have every trendoid in the city flocking to your tables for the ubiquitous salmon and cream cheese sushi rolls. But with economic trends (300 restaurant closings within city limits during the months of September and October!), sushi may turn into a trend too expensive for Jos&eacute; el Plomero to spend his hard earned pesos at. Perhaps the shawarma sandwich is the trend wave of the near future? A bit of online research turned up much confusion, argument, dissent, and bickering about just exactly where to go for the best spit roasted beef, lamb, or chicken wrapped carefully in flatbread - so the only thing there was to do was get myself out there and bite the pita&#8230;.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/arabianfoodcook.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Arabian Food - the shawarma cook station" /></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/arabianfoodshawarma.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Arabian Food - lamb shawarma and falafels" /></center></p>
<p>Claiming to be the first to serve shawarma in the city, <strong>Arabian Food</strong>, Lavalle 697 at the corner of Maip&uacute;, 4328-4700, in Retiro is a small lunch counter with cafeteria trays and those useless plasticized napkinettes that we all hate. Street shills are passing out flyers up and down the block, and the place is clearly popular - Monday at lunchtime there was a short line, and as fast as any of the dozen bar stools or chairs in the place emptied, it was filled by another patron. We settled on one each of the beef and lamb, plus a couple of side falafel on a plate. Arabian Food offers up beef, lamb, and chicken versions, the only place I checked out that does - wrapped in a thin, heated pita bread with a smidgen of chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion, a splash of tahini sauce, and the option for a moderately spicy hot sauce to be added (mostly tomato puree with a little bit of hot pepper in it). The meat is moist though not what I&#8217;d call juicy, and underseasoned - perhaps a shake or two of some salt and pepper, let alone other spices, would serve them well - then again, the falafel too, was a bland fried cone of mashed chickpeas. The place is relatively cheap for the &#8216;hood - 8-11 pesos for a shawarma sandwich, and a &#8220;promo&#8221; of two beef shawarmas with a soda for 19 pesos, a savings of a whopping 2 pesos over ordering those three items individually. There&#8217;s a full menu of other middle eastern specialties, take-out and delivery are both available.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/demashkstation.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Demashk - the shawarma cook station" /></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/demashkshawarma.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Demashk - lamb shawarma and falafels" /></center></p>
<p>This place gets the most whispers about it - and for good reason, it&#8217;s really just dead-on perfect when it comes to the food. <strong>Demashk</strong>, Charcas 3816 in Palermo, 4833-6699, itself barely qualifies as a hole in the wall - or maybe that&#8217;s exactly what it qualifies as - there&#8217;s enough room outside of the kitchen for a service counter and an opposing wall &#8220;bar&#8221; with a few barstools - though they do have a few tables outside on the sidewalk. It&#8217;s a little greasy and grimy. The two cooks (owners?) are friendly and pretty attentive. The place is definitely frequented by the middle eastern community, at least half the people eating and/or who came in to get take out. There&#8217;s a full menu of various specialties available to dine in or take out, they offer delivery and catering services, plus a selection of middle eastern products on a couple of shelves available for purchase.</p>
<p>The shawarma itself, only available in beef. Beautifully cooked, with just a hint of a char on it, and layered with flavor. The meat was juicy, dripping, sloppy - and spiced with a tangy, lemony marinade, along with an array of spices that had been rubbed into it. Smartly, given the juciness, the shawarma is wrapped in a little plastic bag cone to catch the juices rather than having them drip all over everywhere, and a real napkin wrapped around that. This was everything a shawarma should be, and for a mere 7 pesos.</p>
<p><center><img src="/wp-content/haysamstation.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Haysam - the shawarma cook station" /></p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/haysamshawarma.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt="Haysam - lamb shawarma and falafels" /></center></p>
<p><strong>Haysam</strong>, Scalabrini Ortiz 1601, Palermo, 4833-9321, is a tough call. The ambiance is a corner coffee shop, with a few tables inside and a few more out. The staff are friendly, though a little off in space. Despite the fact that it was mid-lunch hour, the shawarma meat (beef only) slowly turning on a spit, wasn&#8217;t close to being ready, and there were already people waiting for their sandwiches, and more of us ordering - in fact, the cook, was downstairs taking a break, while the counter girl wandered about aimlessly, assuring each of us that it would be no more than five minutes (despite the meat still being basically rare), alternated with screaming down the steps for the cook to get upstairs and do something. And, again, despite being lunch hour (around 1 p.m.), she&#8217;d just gotten around to filling the coolers with sodas and water, so none of them were cold, and she only had a few ice cubes to alot to each person.</p>
<p>Now, the shawarma itself, is another story. When the cook came upstairs, eventually (15 minutes after I&#8217;d arrived), he sliced some meat off the spinning spit and tossed it on the flatop grill, where he browned it up quickly. It doesn&#8217;t end up with the same char that way, but hey, it&#8217;s what I was served, so it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going with. The meat itself, nice and juicy, not quite dripping like at the previous spot, but plenty of moisture - that may be due to the grilltop cooking. The seasoning, an intriguing blend that I&#8217;d guess was black pepper and cinnamon - quite different from any I&#8217;ve tried before (I&#8217;m guessing something regional, I should have asked where they were from) - and delicious. Haysam also uses the paper bag cone trick, though puts the napkin inside to absorb some of the juices, which just made it a soggy bit of paper inside the plastic - I just peeled it all off and rewrapped in the plastic alone. I&#8217;d give this place points for having the largest shawarma - easily 50% bigger than the ones at either Demashk or Arabian Food - and at only 8 pesos.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s another place that&#8217;s on my list to check out, but there&#8217;s a minor hitch. The place is a little middle eastern foods market, at the corner of Malab&iacute;a and Cabrera, where I&#8217;ve bought many ingredients in the past. It&#8217;s a great little shop, and they serve up shawarma, but it seems only at lunchtime on Friday and Saturday - both days I rarely have time off to head that way. So, checking the place out will have to wait until a) I have a Friday or Saturday off when I feel like having shawarma, or b) someone decides to stop and pick me one up to go and delivers it over here. I&#8217;m slightly skeptical, only because the owner of the shop spent so much time assuring me that he has the best shawarma, that no one else in town remotely compares, and I shouldn&#8217;t try one anywhere else - and then admitting he&#8217;s never tried anyone else&#8217;s in town. I have no problem with an ego, and know many chefs who have big ones, but that was just silly.</p>
<p>Those four are the only places I had recommended that offer cheap, to go or quick bite shawarma in town. I&#8217;m sure there are more, and I&#8217;m happy to check out other suggestions. There are plenty of sit-down, nicer dining style restaurants, like <em>Chef Iuseff</em> or <em>Hanan</em> that offer shawarma on their menus, but we&#8217;re talking more platter style service than sandwich, and prices in the 25-30 peso range. I&#8217;d also had a small place called <em>Al Amal</em> recommended to me, but it turns out they&#8217;re no longer serving lunch except on Saturdays, and, at least based on the menu posted in their window, they don&#8217;t offer shawarma - I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s something they&#8217;ve simply stopped having on the menu, or something that is offered up as a daily special - it also looks more like a sit-down dining spot, despite being small.</p>
