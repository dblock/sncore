  <title type='text'>Sushi Thai at the Park</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SRXeT-fJSZI/AAAAAAAAANE/s-T1JXcWSa4/s1600-h/thai1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SRXeT-fJSZI/AAAAAAAAANE/s-T1JXcWSa4/s320/thai1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5266359774052174226" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was a rainy day, and I was about to get a head cold (although I didn't know it yet). My husband and I had lunch at &lt;a href="http://www.sushithaigarden.com/Sushi-Thai_at-The-Park.asp"&gt;Sushi Thai&lt;/a&gt;, and it was just what I was hoping it would be-- warming, good, and modern. I think it may have postponed my cold a bit. It at least gave me some good food memories while I recuperated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really aren't that many Thai places in the Capital Region (one on Lark Street that's very hole-in-the-wall; and Thai Bangkok on Wolf Road), so I was excited to learn of Sushi Thai. There is another one &lt;a href="http://www.sushithaigarden.com/Sushi-Thai_saratoga.asp"&gt;in Saratoga, &lt;/a&gt;where I have been once before. The Clifton Park location has a clean, modern feeling with an open airy big room with a bar/sushi area. A pleasant place to dine. At around 1:30 pm we missed the lunch crowd, but there was one other couple there while we ate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We shared spring rolls to start, and they were small, but good. Then came the main courses: chicken thai melon curry for me, and red curry for him. They looked pretty much identical, but they did not taste entirely the same. My husband's dish was  milder and had a definite, yummy basil taste. There were actual basil leaves in his sauce. Mine was nice and spicy. Thai melon is a sort of zucchini. I had fun imagining the big vats of sauce they must keep in the kitchen, along with prepared vegetables and meats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SRXdyLjpezI/AAAAAAAAAM0/wyNIpA2a05M/s1600-h/dish1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SRXdyLjpezI/AAAAAAAAAM0/wyNIpA2a05M/s320/dish1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5266359193445169970" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The menu is extensive, although we ordered from the mix 'n match curry section. There are also sushi options, rice, noodles, and fried dishes. They also have things like Tamarind or Bangkok duck. And of course, Pad Thai, which I plan on trying next time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something sweet and inviting about the place that makes you want to go back. Maybe it's the little good luck kitty in the entranceway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sushi Thai is located at 1707 Route 9 in Clifton Park.&lt;br /&gt;Telephone: 348-0100. Hours:&lt;br /&gt;LUNCH&lt;br /&gt;M-Sun. 11:30-3&lt;br /&gt;DINNER&lt;br /&gt;Sun.-Thurs. 5 pm - 10 pm and Fri. and Sat 5-10:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SRXgk7df01I/AAAAAAAAANM/AwXgLqMmwcQ/s1600-h/kit.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SRXgk7df01I/AAAAAAAAANM/AwXgLqMmwcQ/s320/kit.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5266362264320987986" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Making Pierogies</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SP4BcW-HyNI/AAAAAAAAAMk/81O3omsRSmc/s1600-h/pierog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SP4BcW-HyNI/AAAAAAAAAMk/81O3omsRSmc/s320/pierog.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259643001529419986" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I actually did it. For the first time in my life, I made noodles from scratch and then filled them to make pierogies. I have to say it was way easier than I imagined! I used my hands to blend the dough together and it was really easy to knead (way easier than bread dough). The most time-consuming part was filling and boiling all those little dumplings (about 50 total!) But the best part is that now I have lots of frozen pierogies that all we have to do to eat is defrost and fry.  The picture to the left shows the pierogies after they've been boiled for about 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here they are after they've been fried in coconut oil:&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SP4BjPAG5mI/AAAAAAAAAMs/2JlCQrph3bw/s1600-h/pierog2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SP4BjPAG5mI/AAAAAAAAAMs/2JlCQrph3bw/s320/pierog2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259643119649351266" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I got the recipe from this &lt;a href="http://pittsburgh.about.com/od/recipes/r/pierogies.htm"&gt;About.com web site;&lt;/a&gt; none of the cookbooks I have at home had really adequate recipes for the noodle dough. I knew that just flour and water wasn't going to cut it (as one of my cookbooks advised). So I went for this one, which uses a high fat content with butter and sour cream. And indeedy they were delicious! I also managed to use up 3 heads of cabbage that I had grown in my garden for the filling. For the filling I used a recipe from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Please-Table-Anya-von-Bremzen/dp/0894807536"&gt;Please to the Table&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful cookbook with Russian and Eastern European recipes. It called for cabbage, chopped egg, dill, and salt and pepper.  The dill I had growing in my garden, so that was easy. I also added some fried onion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something wonderful about really making food from scratch like this. I thought it would take up lots of time; but instead, it expanded out my time and involved all my senses. And I involved my husband in the filling/boiling part, so it was even bonding time. Ultimately it saved me time because I didn't have to go to the grocery store or out to get food, and instead I made several meals' worth of food in one evening.</content>

  <title type='text'>August notes...</title>
  <content type='html'>I've been really delinquent on this blog lately because I've been busy! The garden is bursting right now and I have some food canning/preserving to do. Farmer's Market today for eggs and cookies. Making zucchini pancakes and salsa tomorrow. I've been buying wild-caught salmon at Hannaford and grilling it= out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;last night went to &lt;a href="http://www.eatdrinkbellinis.com/"&gt;Bellini's&lt;/a&gt; in Clifton Park and it was okay, but not the kind of place you'd go out of your way for. Typical suburban strip mall Italian joint with huge portions, over-friendly waitstaff, but decent pastas. Our salad was pathetic, though: lots of the greens were actually yellow. Which to my mind is inexcusable this time of year. We needed to get out of the house, though, and the pasta with chicken in garlic cream sauce was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We Love Troy!&lt;br /&gt;Just in case you haven't seen this, it's worth a gander:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SLChKQd9xwI/AAAAAAAAAMU/P4GZlI4Ee4M/s1600-h/burk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SLChKQd9xwI/AAAAAAAAAMU/P4GZlI4Ee4M/s320/burk.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5237863564223301378" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says: Burke's Blue Collar, A Working-Class Bar. CHEAP BOOZE, NASTY STAFF, PRETTY GOOD FOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can't beat it for truth in advertising. And then there's this life-sized cardboard cutout just as a bonus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SLChQhHCKFI/AAAAAAAAAMc/7NDdTca1ftA/s1600-h/obama.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SLChQhHCKFI/AAAAAAAAAMc/7NDdTca1ftA/s320/obama.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5237863671769737298" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Wednesday Farmer's Market, Little Italy</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SG6R-qBy6uI/AAAAAAAAALU/sXC1c7PFbyc/s1600-h/fm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SG6R-qBy6uI/AAAAAAAAALU/sXC1c7PFbyc/s320/fm.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219269523788720866" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troy now has a farmer's market on Wednesdays from 3-6. It's in Little Italy, behind the old Vanilla Bean bakery. It's a perfect spot for a farmer's market-- lots of parking and lots of space. There were maybe about 12 or so vendors selling everything from fresh produce-- strawberries, greens, carrots--to yarn and candy. I stopped Four Brothers, a cheesemongery, and bought some delicious, fresh haloumi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SG6TPdWuckI/AAAAAAAAAL8/RnjHVzI2ci0/s1600-h/chees.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SG6TPdWuckI/AAAAAAAAAL8/RnjHVzI2ci0/s320/chees.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219270911956251202" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also got some cookies at the nearby Ridvan bakery. And this is what I did with the haloumi:&lt;br /&gt;Salad. First I toasted the walnuts and the haloumi in the toaster oven. Then added olive oil, pepper, and salt. The lettuce is from my neighbors' garden. Delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SG6SMJbDgSI/AAAAAAAAALk/ei7aqdON0cI/s1600-h/halm.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SG6SMJbDgSI/AAAAAAAAALk/ei7aqdON0cI/s320/halm.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5219269755554464034" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

It is run by the same people who brought us Ocean Palace, which closed this year because of something having to do with the ownership of the building. Bring a big appetite with you: you will want to order everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CCK is much smaller than Ocean Palace, but the menu is just as dazzling with variety and the food just as authentic. If anything, there is a cozier vibe at CCK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with my friend who also loves Chinese food and we had a feast:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SGO4n1q2JzI/AAAAAAAAALM/X6DxT5cbWvQ/s1600-h/fish.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SGO4n1q2JzI/AAAAAAAAALM/X6DxT5cbWvQ/s320/fish.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5216215787986364210" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the flounder in black bean sauce (a special, similar to the sea bass I used to get at Ocean Palace). You can get the dim sum all day, which my friend did, as they didn't have the crispy chicken he wanted (they said this particular dish would be available on Saturdays). We also tried their congee, something I had never had. This one had chicken and peanut in it. It is very simple (just a mushy rice soup basically) but delicious, something that I imagine would be supergood in the depths of winter: &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SGO4hn1h7kI/AAAAAAAAALE/A9rAIYWqj70/s1600-h/congee.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/SGO4hn1h7kI/AAAAAAAAALE/A9rAIYWqj70/s320/congee.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5216215681193864770" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menu is mind-bogglingly huge and includes everything from your typical dishes loved by Americans (spring rolls, beef with broccoli, Lo Mein) to the more exotic: Conch with Brown Mushrooms, Jelly Fish (part of their dim sum menu), Fried Fish Head in Casserole. I will have to go back and see if their in-house menu is different from what I remember at Ocean Palace. It seemed pretty similar to me. Thank God. I was so worried when Ocean Palace closed. I know now that I will be able to make it through another winter, thanks to CCK.</content>

  <title type='text'>3 Great Things in Troy Right Now</title>

It didn't last very long after this photo was taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of yummy things to report on in Troy.&lt;br /&gt;In no particular order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.ciaobellagelato.com/flavors/"&gt;Ciao Bella&lt;/a&gt; gelato at &lt;a href="http://www.lemarchevert.com/"&gt;Le Marche Vert!&lt;/a&gt; I'm growing quite fond of this little market; it is like a food boutique,a small shop offering gourmet foods, and you can always find something worth getting here (cheeses, some takeout prepared foods, chocolate). The Ciao Bella gelato, served in cups to go, is not to be missed. Favorite flavors: Hazelnut; Blackberry Cabernet; and Chocolate Orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Parmesan cookies at &lt;a href="http://www.spillnthebeans.com/"&gt;Spillin' the Beans&lt;/a&gt;. I bought 6 of these for just $1.25 the other day. They are so good-- great with wine, salad, or just as a snack. They are basically like a shortbread cookie but flavored with parmesan-- savory. I am addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/olivers-naturals-troy"&gt;Oliver's Naturals&lt;/a&gt; rocks! I can't say this enough. I went in there the other day and got, get this: a shiitake grilled cheese sandwhich, on Ezekiel bread with some kind of wonderful pesto or garlic mayonnaise. And I got a cup of joe that had been *hand ground.* (Baby Oliver likes to crank the grinder-- he's so cute). You will feel totally nourished-- physically, spiritually, mentally-- by the food, and Diana, Adam, and Lauren make everyone feel right at home.</content>

  <content type='html'>Since I've written about Ocean Palace before here, I thought I should tell any readers that it has closed. This post by Steve Barnes at the Times Union explains that their lease ran out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.timesunion.com/tablehopping/?s=ocean+palace&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Click here to read all the info. we have so far. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know what CCK is? Or what it stands for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'd think that a restaurant wouldn't just abandon loyal customers like that-- that they'd leave a sign on the old building or issue a press release or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, &lt;a href="http://dishanddirt.blogspot.com/2007/07/national-ice-cream-month.html"&gt;Moxie's is open &lt;/a&gt;again-- there is a reason to live.</content>

  <title type='text'>Ask and Ye shall Receive (Pizza)</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R-sBULfRqhI/AAAAAAAAAJk/B8KvEGskCts/s1600-h/pizz.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R-sBULfRqhI/AAAAAAAAAJk/B8KvEGskCts/s320/pizz.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5182237242412870162" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after I was bellyaching in my last post about the lack of gourmet Italian, what happens? The appearance of some really good, contemporary Italian in Troy. It almost makes me believe that wishes come true if you whine long and hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;    Enter: Bacchus, a brick-oven pizza joint downstairs from Daisy Baker's at 33 Second Street in Troy. It's operated by the same folks who do Daisy Baker's. We've been to Bacchus already twice. This is just the kind of spot Troy needs-- casual dining with a little gourmet flair. Somewhere to have a glass of wine with your dinner on a weeknight. There are so many nights when we don't have anything planned for dinner at home, don't want to do take-out, but don't want to go anywhere fancy: and for those nights, Bacchus is the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R-sEr7fRqiI/AAAAAAAAAJs/UbNfO_Wmeeg/s1600-h/pize.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R-sEr7fRqiI/AAAAAAAAAJs/UbNfO_Wmeeg/s320/pize.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5182240948969646626" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The menu itself is small-ish: there is basically pizza, or pasta. On the pizza, you can go with their suggested toppings, or create your own. Toppings included artichokes, broccoli, shrimp, some meat toppings, and garlic. We've done our own pizza, both times using ricotta and extra garlic with spinach. I ordered a salad; and the second time there I tried the roasted garlic with foccaccia, which I can't say enough good things about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R-sBKrfRqfI/AAAAAAAAAJU/06T-ijkQwV4/s1600-h/salad.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R-sBKrfRqfI/AAAAAAAAAJU/06T-ijkQwV4/s320/salad.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5182237079204112882" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The salad is simple but good, made with fresh mixed greens and a lovely oil and vinegar type dressing. It's the perfect foil for the pizza. You can order wine or beer, and the service has been friendly and helpful. They've done a great job renovating the space; it's warm and cozy with authentic brick walls (good old Troy bricks). There are little nook-like spaces with booths, or you can dine in a larger area all the way inside to the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love DeFazio's, but I am a sucker for a good thin-crust pizza. If I could pick only one food to eat day in and day out, it would probably be pizza. What, actually, is there to food besides pizza? It's got all the four food groups: dough, cheese, oil, and tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pizza is thin-crust, which is great because in Troy we already have DeFazio's, where the crust is more substantial. DeFazio's crust is not deep dish, but it's certainly not thin-crust. You can never really have too much pizza in one town. As they grow, which Bacchus most certainly will because it's already proving a popular spot, I hope they add maybe more dinner-type salads along with more pizza and pasta toppings: for example, things a little more 'upscale' like goat cheese or basil. The ricotta and spinach are great, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then, though, cheers: we finally have a casual, contemporary Italian joint to call our own.</content>

  <title type='text'>Verdile's, an old standby</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R8nTXvKiMHI/AAAAAAAAAJM/vDPWTCaSW4U/s1600-h/manicot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R8nTXvKiMHI/AAAAAAAAAJM/vDPWTCaSW4U/s320/manicot.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172898051762827378" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdile's has been on my list of places to try, and we finally made it there last week. I was impressed by the spaciousness, the calm decor, and the crowd, obviously made up of long-term patrons. This is truly a family Italian restaurant. It's like an old pair of jeans: you can dress them up or down, making a meal at Verdile's into something casual or fancy, as you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were three, and although there were plenty of seats, it took them a while to seat us (although granted, we were waiting for our 3rd member for a while, too). While we waited we got to see that everyone who came in was warmly greeted and there was definitely a community feeling afoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were hungry. They brought white bread. It was not warm. I was somewhat disappointed by this. We ordered a salad for two, which really covered all 3 of us nicely. Nothing unusual to report about the salad.  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R8nSa_KiMFI/AAAAAAAAAI8/Y9_p5XMjsaQ/s1600-h/salad.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R8nSa_KiMFI/AAAAAAAAAI8/Y9_p5XMjsaQ/s320/salad.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172897008085774418" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then came the main courses. I ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp; my friend ordered regular fettucine alfredo. I figure, I never make anything this sinfully rich at home-- why not? If it's truly a family place, then their fettucine alfredo would show it. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R8nS4fKiMGI/AAAAAAAAAJE/UAgRStd4Rlc/s1600-h/shrimp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R8nS4fKiMGI/AAAAAAAAAJE/UAgRStd4Rlc/s320/shrimp.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172897514891915362" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It was good-- I mean, how can anything with that much cream *not* be good?! The shrimp were fine, too. But again, no surprises here. The waiters wore tuxes, or tux-like outfits-- very formal. Yet there was the crumbly kind of parmesan on the table-- not real parmesan. I found this incongruous. It's sort of like having chef Boyardee on Wedgewood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband got the manicotti, which I tried, and it was perfectly adequate. His portion was a normal-sized portion, whereas the fettucine gave me lunch the next day. We didn't have room for dessert. I gained 2 pounds from my fettucine. (Yes, I've been very weight-conscious lately, as I've been trying to lose some of my significant winter padding.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdile's is located at 572 Second Ave., between 115 and 116th Streets, not far from the Snowman in the 'Burgh. These are their hours:&lt;br /&gt;               Mon-Thu 11:30am-10pm,                   Fri-Sat 11:30am-11pm,                   Sun 12pm-9pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great hours. Still, I don't think I'm going back there any time soon. The food just isn't interesting enough-- which is a problem I have with so many Italian restaurants here. Where are the healthy greens, the whole wheat crust breads, the many artisanal cheeses that could easily be sourced from NY State? Obviously the vast majority of the ingredients here are shipped in, highly industrialized. The food is formulaic, heavy (tons of veal), and you might as well travel back to 1955, which frankly, I do not care to do. I do understand the sentimental connections people have to places like this, though, and it's good to know that such a standby is still thriving.</content>

  <title type='text'>It's a Family Affair: Oliver's Naturals</title>
  <content type='html'>Troy is lucky to be garnering quite a bit of buzz lately on the food front. We've got the &lt;a href="http://www.troyfoodcoop.com/"&gt;Troy Food Co-op&lt;/a&gt; coming up, promising to be a wonderful destination. If you haven't joined yet, do so now!! From what I hear, they are close to reaching their initial membership goal-- and you know you want to be one of the pioneers. In years to come, it's going to be one of those things you can boast about to your kids and grandkids: "I was one of the first to join in the Troy Food Co-op." "Really, Grandma? You are *so* hip and cool." There's Tosca, and now Le Marche Vert, the little gourmet market right next to Tosca also owned by Chef Larry Shepici. Not to mention all the old standbys: DeFazio's, First Choice Caribbean, Francesca's, Shalimar, Shake Shake Mama's, Ilium Café, Brown's Brew Pub, José Malone's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest addition is Oliver's Naturals, a cozy, inviting vegetarian café on Fulton Street (#459, same block as Shalimar) run by a family: Oliver is the 8-month-old adorable baby mascot. Adam and Lauren are his also-adorable parents, and Adam's mom is the divine Diane, who makes the fabulous biscotti. Even Adam's grandma is involved sometimes making biscotti as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R6Ty5mb3n8I/AAAAAAAAAI0/ITulf1nBO-w/s1600-h/oliver.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R6Ty5mb3n8I/AAAAAAAAAI0/ITulf1nBO-w/s320/oliver.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5162518144257335234" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You walk in and feel like you're in your best friend's living room. You know, the best friend whose mom was cooler than yours. And you always wanted to hang out there because they had the coolest food. There isn't much seating, but there's enough. They have funky decor, like crystals scattered on the tables. And you've got to see Oliver's stuffed Jerry Garcia doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to meet Oliver; go because this is community building at its best, with a lot of locally sourced food, all organics. But you'll want to go back again and again because the food is so AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been there twice already, and everyone I've talked to who's been there gets this kind of converted dazed look in their eyes when they talk about it. The food is that good. I had a cream of tomato soup with a grilled cheese when I first went there, and I'm still thinking about that soup. The grilled cheese was made with a garlic mayonnaise, and came on Ezekiel bread. The next time I went, I got a spinach salad with gorgonzola, and roasted pine nuts. It was so delicious that I forgot I was eating just a salad! It made me feel full, satisfied. It came with home-toasted pita chips. They have fair trade coffees, Maté, and last but not least, home made biscotti. The biscotti I had were dipped in dark chocolate and, get this: made with olive oil. You'd never know it because they sure tasted sinful! They also had nut and cranberry biscotti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just opened in late December. As of the last time I was there, their hours were Sun 9-12 and Monday- Saturday 10 am- 4 pm. It's not many places in Troy that are open Sundays for breakfast. We need this. I'm going to be going there a lot; the food is fantastic, and they just make everyone feel welcome.</content>

  <title type='text'>Guess: which fruits and vegetables contain the most pesticides?</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.ewg.org/"&gt;The Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt; has put together a chart of the worst vegetables and fruits for pesticide load. Can you guess which ones are the most harmful? What do you think: strawberries? That's what I would guess. Oranges? Nah, should be okay, all that rind...What about leafy vegetables?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess again. The top five worst offenders:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table style="padding-top: 0px;" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="95%"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         1 (worst)        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         Peaches        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         100 (highest pesticide load)        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         2        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         Apples        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         96        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         3        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         Sweet Bell Peppers        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         86        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr class="orangeback"&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         4        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         Celery        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         85        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr class="orangeback"&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         5        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         Nectarines        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;        &lt;p class="tabletext"&gt;         84        &lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;      &lt;/tr&gt;      &lt;tr class="orangeback"&gt;       &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;       &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foodnews.org/"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for the full list from foodnews.org.</content>

  <title type='text'>The Hudson Hip Factor</title>
  <content type='html'>Scrumptious pizza that I took home from &lt;a href="http://www.babalouiespizza.com/"&gt;Baba Louie's&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R4e9mjX966I/AAAAAAAAAIk/8rKIeMpgA1k/s1600-h/baba.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R4e9mjX966I/AAAAAAAAAIk/8rKIeMpgA1k/s320/baba.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154296768577268642" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are figs! And spinach. And real mozzarella!!!! This weekend we went to Hudson, where hipness seems concentrated like a shot of espresso. It was just what one needs this time of year-- a little spot of razzmatazz- and I had two sublime food experiences: one at &lt;a href="http://www.verdigrishudson.com/"&gt;Verdigris,&lt;/a&gt; a tea bar/art salon, and the other at &lt;a href="http://www.babalouiespizza.com/"&gt;Baba Louie's&lt;/a&gt;, a fantastic sit-down gourmet pizzeria that also has pasta, panini, soup, and salad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdigris has a bajillion kinds of tea for sale-- greens, reds (rooibus), black teas, tisanes-- and an adorable bakery with luscious looking cake and wonderful cookies. I took home oatmeal cookies and orange shortbreads. They also sell artwork and you can sit down indoors and enjoy your tea or hot chocolate (my husband tried the hot chocolate, which was truly wonderful-- dark and luscious and subtly flavored with something smoky, like maybe vanilla). They have a lovely outdoor patio area where you can sit in nicer weather.  There are lots of places in Hudson to spend the afternoon reading with a cup of something warm and tasty, and Verdigris is definitely one I'd like to go back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't imagine anyone who *wouldn't* like &lt;a href="http://www.babalouiespizza.com/"&gt;Baba Louie's.&lt;/a&gt; Ingredients are fresh, often organic (the crust is made with either organic sourdough or wheat-free spelt; mixed greens in salads are organic), toppings are imaginative but not overweening, and the crust is thin and crispy. We debated heavily between the Melanzana Cardinale pizza, which comes with eggplant, plum tomatoes, fresh mozarella, smoked gouda and pesto; or the Isabella Pizzarella, which comes with roasted sweet potatoes and parsnips (I'm a sucker for parsnips), caramelized onions, roasted garlic, mozzarella, fennel, and balsamic vinegar. We decided to go with yet a third choice, the Dolce Vita: spinach, tomato sauce, mozzarella, figs, gorgonzola, prosciutto and parmesan and "topped with rosemary infused oil" except we ordered it without the prosciutto. It sounds like a lot, but the flavors married brilliantly, and all these toppings were just that-- toppings--they didn't take over the whole pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pizza was so good that I now dream about going back for another. The figs tasted like sausage, which for a vegetarian is pure heaven= having that meaty sweety fat flavor without fake 'meat' (veggie strips, texturized protein, etc). It was just a gorgeous blend of sweet and salty, picante and mild, chewy and crispy. Heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a large pizza we still had half of it to take home (and that's something to look forward to). They also offer smaller (10 inch) pizzas. They have a pasta every evening and a choice of salads: we got a salad with figs and pecans, and it was served with a lemon dressing that was out of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was warm and prompt; and the restaurant is open and airy yet you have privacy because there are booths and tables separated by half-walls. There are candles on the tables-- you could take a date here and feel at ease. We also saw families with kids who seemed like they were loving it. What a place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it all left me a bit starry-eyed and wondering about Hudson. And I realized: there isn't a SINGLE place in the entire Albany area (including Troy, Schenectady, Clifton Park, etc) that is like Baba Louie's: a simple but gourmet/organic restaurant with pizzas and pastas amenable to casual but quality dining. There are tons of Italian places, but they are either family style restaurants, where you are basically served enough food to power a small football team; or they are ultra-shmancy, like&lt;a href="http://www.cafecapriccio.com/"&gt; Cafe Capriccio&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://toscagrille.com/cheflarry/"&gt;Tosca&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing in between. The only middle-of-the-road casual dining category includes places like Brown's Brewpub or the Pump Station-- nothing particularly memorable about the American food (burgers, wings, fish), and gargantuan portions. I just want a decent casual European style dining place-- *not* another big deal leather-banquette necktie and chandeliers place--that satisfies. A restaurant that serves things like goat cheese and balsamic vinegar without making these ingredients seem fussy or unusual. They aren't unusual for me-- these are things I use in my kitchen all the time, along with pine nuts, fresh imported parmesan, organic greens, and fresh mozzarella. But often when I see them served in a restaurant around here, I get the impression that the chef thinks they're 'exotic' as though they've just discovered them. Newsflash: &lt;a href="http://www.worldpantry.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/silver/home.d2w/report"&gt;The Silver Palate&lt;/a&gt; cookbook came out 25 years ago! Get with the times, Albany, and take a page from Hudson's dining scene-- I think we're ready.</content>

  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13Q6Dy23GI/AAAAAAAAAH8/ZTdR2bp6LcU/s1600-h/cafepark.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13Q6Dy23GI/AAAAAAAAAH8/ZTdR2bp6LcU/s320/cafepark.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142496045396581474" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where was I the other day? Near the corner of nowhere and Route 4 in East Greenbush. It doesn't look like much, but trust me, if you're living in East Greenbush, this is going to be heaven because you can get good clean organic food for lunch here: at Organic Roots. Apparently the place has been around for a while (like a couple of years) but I only found out about it a couple of weeks ago thanks to one of my sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Roots is a cozy café with sandwiches, a soup of the day, coffee, and assorted health-nut drinks. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13Sfjy23HI/AAAAAAAAAIE/Cq2UWNP5Thw/s1600-h/blackb2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13Sfjy23HI/AAAAAAAAAIE/Cq2UWNP5Thw/s320/blackb2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142497789153303666" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Service was quick and attentive. There were two women in there when I was there, and they also commented that it was surprising they hadn't heard of the place until recently, in spite of one of the women living right nearby. Organic Roots needs better advertising (like better signage for starts). It also needs desserts. When I was there, they didn't even have chocolate bars by the register. Isn't it some kind of law that all lunch places must have chocolate? [Edited to add: the owner has written to me and expressed that they usually *do* have dessert but happened to be out the day I visited. She wrote, "I went to school for pastry arts and the day you came we hade no cookies or muffins but if you were a regular you would have known we usually always have cookies or some kind of dessert." Thanks for the clarification. Also, she says there are chocolate bars on the retail shelf.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13Uzjy23KI/AAAAAAAAAIU/VJBlLzmCkZ8/s1600-h/orgroots.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13Uzjy23KI/AAAAAAAAAIU/VJBlLzmCkZ8/s320/orgroots.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142500331773942946" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chocolate appeases the masses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lovely sandwich with avocado and veggies plus a cup of broccoli soup. It was tasty; there was some kind of flavorful sauce (I want to say aioli) on the bread, and everything was fresh. They gave me a cup of bean salad (I could have also gotten something else-- I think pasta salad) and some croutons. I felt so healthy! I was then ready for sinfulness with dessert. See, this is the real reason to eat healthy: then you can feel so virtuous you don't mind being a little sinful from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13V_zy23LI/AAAAAAAAAIc/WmHtZ5I6mRw/s1600-h/soupy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R13V_zy23LI/AAAAAAAAAIc/WmHtZ5I6mRw/s320/soupy.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142501641738968242" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Organic Roots is at 91 Troy Road, at the intersection of Route 4 with Route 151, just West of I-90. It's a bit far for me to go there often, but it's nice to know it's there.</content>

  <title type='text'>Cella Bistro: If You Lived There, You'd Be Home By Now</title>
  <content type='html'>Cella Bistro is for me a schlep. I define 'schlep' as anything more than about a 15 minute drive around here, especially if it's winter. Also, I define 'schlep' as anything taking place in the greater Schenectady area-- apologies to Schenectady folks. I'm sure you feel the same way about Troy, so it's even. The word also is appropriate here because, ultimately, I felt that this would be a fine restaurant if we lived nearby, but it isn't something I plan to go out of my way for again. And that's not just because I'm grouchy. If you met me in person, you'd never realize how grouchy I am. For the most part I hide it really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0OlYNt0tiI/AAAAAAAAAH0/uSJ4nsEavv0/s1600-h/picksx.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0OlYNt0tiI/AAAAAAAAAH0/uSJ4nsEavv0/s320/picksx.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5135129835549799970" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your consideration is this wall of family photos that my husband and I had almost an hour to contemplate as we waited for our appetizers. It didn't make me feel like part of the family. It made me feel like maybe there is some kind of competition, and the people with bigger families win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard numerous good things about Cella Bistro from acquaintances and also from various reviews. &lt;a href="http://blogs.timesunion.com/tablehopping/?p=593"&gt;Click here for Steve Barnes' review&lt;/a&gt; of them this summer. It's supposed to be a more contemporary Italian place than what we usually expect in the Capital Region, where old school red-sauce joints are King. So we schlepped, and then we further schlepped, because we parked about a block away on a quiet residential street that was full of cars. The parking lot there is small (although to our chagrin once we hoofed it in the cold to the restaurant we discovered there were, in fact, plenty of spaces right in the lot). It's in a building that looks like it was once a house, although it's been nicely redecorated, with warm-toned brown painted walls and new beadboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our initial expenditure of schlep energy in the drive, we further depleted our patience resources by waiting for service that was creepingly slow. At one point, our waiter, who was of the more obsequious and frighteningly cheerful variety, apologized, saying there was a large party of 20 people that was slowing everything down. We were understanding, really we were. And then we realized that we had been sitting there for almost an hour and hadn't even gotten our salads yet. So that was count one against Cella Bistro, although as an experienced restaurant-goer knows, sometimes these things happen. Still, times like this I feel like saying, "Hey, will you just show me the kitchen-- I'll fix the salad!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food itself was uneven. The appetizers weren't that good: this spring roll&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0Ojd9t0tdI/AAAAAAAAAHM/fRykurvgkWY/s1600-h/roll.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0Ojd9t0tdI/AAAAAAAAAHM/fRykurvgkWY/s400/roll.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5135127735310792146" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is an example of nouveau cuisine making too much of itself, with goat cheese and artichoke filling (artichokes should never be used to 'fill' anything. I have too much respect for artichokes). The endive salad we shared was mostly just that-- endive with a too-heavy dressing sitting inside a radicchio leaf. But by that time, we were hungry and grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lovely rosé wine from Provence. I wouldn't mind another right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0Ojmtt0teI/AAAAAAAAAHU/G8IK1oij_xY/s1600-h/bolog.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0Ojmtt0teI/AAAAAAAAAHU/G8IK1oij_xY/s400/bolog.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5135127885634647522" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then dinner: my husband's bolognese was really good, with homemade wide pasta noodles; mine was mahi-mahi with a sauce that was too sweet. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0Ojsdt0tfI/AAAAAAAAAHc/HwKHCfoYnEc/s1600-h/fish.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/R0Ojsdt0tfI/AAAAAAAAAHc/HwKHCfoYnEc/s400/fish.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5135127984418895346" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There's nothing that turns me off more than too much sweetness. Cloying and saccharine, too much sweetness is always trying to hide something. But the haricots verts were the real thing, which I appreciate because I don't have much luck growing them like that (nice, dark and skinny) in my garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene was quite the Niskayuna-Schenectady do-gooders scene. People at a table behind us were yukking it up in that way that people who function in society yet like to get drunk do. And our waiter seemed to egg them on by chatting them up. This loud group then moved to the bar area and it was remarkably quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We opted out of dessert. It's probably a good thing because today alone I hate half a large farmer's market chocolate cookie (Placid Baker, I love you!) and a biscotti as well as a bag of Cheetos. 'Tis the season, folks. Happy Thanksgiving.</content>

  <title type='text'>Chai Tea—Masala Chai, That Is</title>
  <content type='html'>I tend to be something of an obsessive personality. I get fixated on a thing, and then I worry it like a dog worries a bone. I look at it from this angle and that. I gnaw. I ponder. Lately I've done this with Chai tea, which is inherently obsession-worthy: it's everywhere (Starbucks, restaurants) yet it's hard to find good, truly spicy Chai tea. Chai means 'tea' in many languages, but I'm after masala chai, which is what Westerners mean when they say Chai. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai"&gt;Wikipedia has a decent entry&lt;/a&gt; on it. Go to a grocery store and you will find several different things claiming to be Chai: vanilla chai tea, even green chai (yuck), powder mix for Chai that includes the sweetener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not drink caffeine, and so it became of the utmost importance in my life to find Chai decaf tea that didn't taste like cardboard water. Many of the teas purporting to be Chai (sold by Stash, Celestial Seasonings and the like) *smell* good and spicy but when you taste them they taste like nothing. Worse than nothing, because at least if you're drinking nothing, you expect nothing. When you expect spicy warmth and find nothing, it's disappointing. So I visited the India Bazaar, a great store on 1321 Central Ave., where I bought fresh ginger, cardamom still green in its pods, and peanuts coated with hot spices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rw7ioDOvVcI/AAAAAAAAAG8/X0sYg_Phsb4/s1600-h/bazaar.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rw7ioDOvVcI/AAAAAAAAAG8/X0sYg_Phsb4/s400/bazaar.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5120279004056606146" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had found &lt;a href="http://www.odie.org/chai/rec/rec101.html"&gt;this recipe, &lt;/a&gt;which claimed that you do not want to use leaf tea to make Chai-- and right they are. Every time I made Chai using leaf tea, it turned out wrong. The tea leaf turned the tea too bitter, and the spices couldn't compete. I wanted to buy authentically Indian tea-- not the expensive leaf kind of tea, but just the everyday kind, hoping to find decaf. But apparently, people from India do not believe in decaf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rw7jMDOvVdI/AAAAAAAAAHE/RQ82Lvx5F60/s1600-h/tea.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rw7jMDOvVdI/AAAAAAAAAHE/RQ82Lvx5F60/s400/tea.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5120279622531896786" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These are the right brands, but they all have caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;I can really understand their point about caffeine (alas, I love things that are bad for me), and maybe next time I will feel brave enough to buy one of these boxes of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started experimenting with the Chai recipe. At first it was not good. So I added more spice and made it again. And then, when I finally got it how I like it, I decided that it's no use to make just one cup of Chai. You want to have lots of it around, so you can easily reheat some for a midnight snack or early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here's what I came up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big pot O Decaf Chai&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a sturdy mortar and pestle for this, as well as a strainer with fine holes, around the size that can fit over your standard tea mug. I found an excellent cup-size strainer at the Hannaford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 cups water&lt;br /&gt;8 tsp. Orange pekoe tea (or tea from 8 tea bags) but DO NOT use leaf tea! I have used Tetley and Salada.&lt;br /&gt;20-30 pods cardamom. Cardamom can make it taste bitter, so maybe more like 20, depending on your taste.&lt;br /&gt;1 hunk of ginger (1-2 inch chunk)&lt;br /&gt;15 or so black peppercorns&lt;br /&gt;4 medium sticks of cinnamon (more if the sticks are thin)&lt;br /&gt;15 allspice berries&lt;br /&gt;15 cloves&lt;br /&gt;some honey&lt;br /&gt;2 cups milk or half and half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place the cardamom and ginger together in your mortar and pestle and pound away until you are satisfied, and until the cardamom seeds, which are black, emerge from the pods and are crushed. (This part is very therapeutic). Then do the same with the rest of the spices, making sure you break up the cinnamon well enough that there is some powder as well as little bits of cinnamon bark. The more you break things up, the more surface area there will be = the more spicy your tea will be. Put it all in the water with the tea, and then simmer it for about 10 minutes. This part is important: too little time, and your tea won't taste like much of anything, but too much time, and it will be bitter. Add 2 cups of milk or half and half if you're feeling decadent, and heat through. Then add about 2 Tbs. honey (or to taste) and strain.</content>

I've also got eggplants, fennel, cabbage, squash (summer and winter this year! A banner year!), potatoes, carrots, chard, kale, and broccoli. Today I made a cold tomato soup--kind of a gazpacho with lime, cumin, and cinnamon.

Unlike some writers who have argued for the locavore movement lately (I'm still really wanting to read Barbara Ehrenreich's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle;&lt;/span&gt; and there was a really&lt;a href="http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/37273/"&gt; funny feature in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/span&gt; by Manny Howard&lt;/a&gt; detailing his many failures trying to live off what his yard produced in Brooklyn), I don't think we will solve our many environmental problems by hunkering down by the campfire eating moldy but homegrown turnips through the long Northeastern winters. Every place has its own local food culture, and trading to mutual benefit is never a problem. It's not the 'where' as much as the 'what' and the 'how.' Do I really need to buy apples from Washington when I can get them from New York? No, but if I want pineapple, bananas, or green peppers in the winter, I'm going to have to get them from afar. Is this reasonable? Yes, but it's also reasonable to ask that these things be sustainably farmed and shipped with respect to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are social creatures, and we need each other to survive. There is no such thing as truly self-sufficient. Still, my vegetable garden has become central to my life these past few years, changing the way I think about food, and I've gotten better at growing stuff. Mostly, I'm more organized than I was (my first year I had a tomato forest and total chaos! But it was beautiful) and better at spacing plants. I just never believe that such tiny seedlings will grow up into edible veggies. But look, a casserole of roasted garden veggies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/RvLvzDOvVbI/AAAAAAAAAG0/fmuQ83iTasg/s1600-h/cass.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/RvLvzDOvVbI/AAAAAAAAAG0/fmuQ83iTasg/s400/cass.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5112412187338429874" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of growing my own vegetables for a small portion of the year, I've come to realize how much sweat labor food takes. (Answer: lots.) From digging and composting to planting, weeding constantly, watering, and harvesting, it's pretty much non-stop work. It's one of the most pleasurable forms of work I know, however, and oh do those tomatoes taste sweet! Even at the farmer's market there aren't such juicy, flavorful tomatoes as I grow. My fav. varieties: Lillian's Yellow heirloom tomatoes, which really don't become ripe until September 1 or so, and Cherokee tomatoes, a dark winey tomato with dark green shoulders. Here is my little plot of earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/RvLvkjOvVaI/AAAAAAAAAGs/uPFEs8EQ9Jw/s1600-h/veg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/RvLvkjOvVaI/AAAAAAAAAGs/uPFEs8EQ9Jw/s400/veg.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5112411938230326690" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I called this blog "Dish and Dirt" is because I believe that what we 'dish' ultimately relies on the condition of our dirt. In plain terms, what we eat grows on this earth, and its quality depends on the soil. Despite a certain degree of cantankerousness (and the desire to keep eating imported chocolate), I do believe that we could all do a lot more local eating. I try to resist processed foods, foods that have traveled too far to get to me (except for chocolate), and especially foods that have been slapped together and shipped with no thought to quality, care, or health. So let's all get out and enjoy those farmer's markets, apple picking farms, and local honey while it's harvest season.</content>

  <title type='text'>River Street Café</title>
  <content type='html'>My husband and I went out to eat at the River Street Café to celebrate our anniversary recently, and it was passably good. I had the cod with an avocado cilantro preparation, my husband had the pasta dish--noodles with vegetables--but I left feeling as I often feel at restaurants: my culinary life has just been made unecessarily complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simplicity is hard to come by. People think that once they've hit on a good thing, we all want more of it. Restraint is the natural companion of quality, but they are both so often missing in life. The stomach doesn't have to be overwhelmed with quantity nor the taste buds drowned in excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The River Street Café is located on 429 River Street, right next to the big parking lot where the summer Troy Farmer's Market takes place. Their telephone is 518-273-2740, and their hours are Tues-Sat. 5:30 until closing, but it's a good idea to call. There were several months this year when it seemed that the restaurant was just closed; perhaps the proprietor was on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the relaxed atmosphere at the River Street Café and its romantic candlelit tables with views of the Hudson River. It's a trustworthy spot, one that many RPI students and professors frequent and take parents and relatives to. Still, I see some room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, there is my fish predicament, which isn't really a criticism of the River Street Café alone, but keeps coming up. Since I'm a vegetarian who eats fish, all the many meat dishes there (the duck, the lamb, the beef) were not options for me. I didn't feel like eating pasta, since I can easily make that at home. That left salmon, Chatham cod, or swordfish, and swordfish I know has high levels of mercury, so that's automatically out. Salmon is everyone's favorite 'safe' fish choice, but unless it's wild Atlantic salmon, chances are you are ingesting PCBs (farmed salmon are fed some fairly vile things, and &lt;a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/Toxic/safe-fish.cfm"&gt;according to this web site, &lt;/a&gt;can be toxic). That left the Chatham cod, and, well, it sounds safe and New England-ey, but it's not much better than salmon.  &lt;a href="http://www.oceansalive.org/eat.cfm?subnav=bestandworst&amp;amp;link=hp"&gt;The Oceans Alive guide&lt;/a&gt; to fish claims Atlantic Cod is not such a great choice, although this isn't as much because of high chemical levels as because it is not sustainably fished. When I asked the waitress what "Chatham cod" meant, she just said it meant it was from Chatham. Hmmm. Well, it's what I got, but I didn't feel that great about it. These days, restaurateurs need to reassure their patrons about fish. We need all the information we can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food we got was good-- it began with a huge plate of tangy tomato noodles that I remember from other times at the River Street Café (but it was a huge plate, too much really). The cilantro-avocado preparation on my fish was wonderful, and the butter homefried potatoes that came with our main course were divine. But it was *WAY* too much food, which made me feel uncomfortable: after an appetizer (a pita pizza with tomato sauce, cheese, and mushroom), a salad that comes with the meal (delicious 'mock' Ceasar), main dishes, and dessert (a triple layered chocolate and coffee-buttercream confection that was also a bit overpowering), I actually felt kind of disgusted with myself, and with American restaurants.</content>

  <title type='text'>This is sad: Vanilla Bean closing</title>
  <content type='html'>After many years being an important business for Troy, the Vanilla Bean has announced it's closing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is &lt;a href="http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=607651"&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="on down" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don't understand is why. I mean I know there are financial difficulties. But given how much people around here love it and how successful they've been, surely someone can come along and salvage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer European style baking (read= less sugar, more chocolate) but I do have a soft spot for the Vanilla Bean's peanut butter fancies, and they've often saved me a lot of hassle when I have to bring something to someone's open house/pot luck/birthday and don't have time to bake myself. The donuts are good, the bread is good (although several years ago I stopped being able to find the sandwich loaf I used to like there). And the Cookie Factory is no match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

  <title type='text'>Ethnic food festivals</title>
  <content type='html'>This is a brief post to say that I'd like to get out to more of the wonderful ethnic food festivals in the Capital Region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've read signs that advertise for an Armenian food festival on Sunday, August 5, from 11-4 on Spring Ave. in Troy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it's &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;amp;amp;um=1&amp;q=armenian+church&amp;amp;near=Troy,+NY&amp;fb=1&amp;amp;view=text&amp;amp;latlng=42713073,-73671002,2313793965006215509"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do go I'll post with pics. Also there are Italian and Greek festivals, not to mention Lebanese, Ukrainian... if anyone has tips on other good festivals to go to, please post and let me know.</content>

  <title type='text'>National Ice Cream Month</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rpl5zNUmcQI/AAAAAAAAAGE/Q8LIdPphBws/s1600-h/moxie1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rpl5zNUmcQI/AAAAAAAAAGE/Q8LIdPphBws/s400/moxie1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5087231174748041474" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, my name is Nosher, and today I'm confessing that I'm addicted to ice cream. Not just any ice cream: it has to be Moxie's. Moxie's has five-- count 'em, five!!!-- different kinds of vanilla, based on where the vanilla bean came from: Tahitian, Mexican, Indonesian, Venetian, and Haitian. They have a Cajun chocolate peanut butter that is out of this world, not to mention the coconut with chocolate almonds, Horchata, an intense rum raisin, and many other unusual home made creations (orange-pineapple, red wine sorbet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two kinds of people in the Capital District: those who like ice cream, and those who like Moxie's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The servings are rational (not the ginormous pig-o-rama portions we Americans have gotten so used to). The ice cream is not too sweet. Way way too many people put too much sugar in their desserts, until you can't taste the real flavor anymore. Not Moxie's. The business has been around  since the 1930s and runs out of an old dairy building, complete with the screen windows where you place your order. Moxie's will even sell you 1/2 gallons -- larger for parties if you call ahead. You can read more about ice cream stands in&lt;a href="http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2000/06/05/focus1.html"&gt; this great article by the Business Review. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July is &lt;a href="http://www.idfa.org/facts/icmonth/page1.cfm"&gt;National Ice Cream Month&lt;/a&gt;, and tomorrow (Sunday the 15th) is National Ice Cream Day, so I'm going to go do my patriotic duty and head to Moxie's again. Moxie's celebrates by having the most flavors of the season on National Ice Cream day. Tomorrow, they will add 17 more flavors to their already impressive list. There will also be face painting, free pens, and lots of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have to object to at Moxie's is that some of the flavors are just... odd. For example, I tried banana walnut today, and it was pink, and didn't taste much like bananas. Or walnuts. Other flavors have just been strange. But there are so many great flavors here, and you can always taste test before you make a commitment. AND you can get a special vanilla-around-the-world sample dish; some day I will do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rpl389UmcOI/AAAAAAAAAF0/oewr_4gAGok/s1600-h/moxie3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rpl389UmcOI/AAAAAAAAAF0/oewr_4gAGok/s200/moxie3.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5087229143228510434" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diehard Moxie fans often buy gallons of ice cream to last through the winter, because the stand closes at the end of August. As I support seasonal eating, I think it's great that Moxie's is seasonal. But I'm certainly not above stocking my freezer with stores for the winter.</content>

  <title type='text'>My New Addiction: Roma Importing Co.</title>
  <content type='html'>Roma Foods Importing Company is in Latham in Cobbee Road, in the shadow of the Price Chopper plaza. It's one of those great secret places you can live here for years and not know about, because it's on one of those little side streets off Route 9. It's awesome and you must go, now and again! I didn't have my camera with me, but here's a pic of the booty:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/RmGsHgHGYGI/AAAAAAAAAFk/yaXPHsY_64A/s1600-h/roma-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/RmGsHgHGYGI/AAAAAAAAAFk/yaXPHsY_64A/s400/roma-4.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5071523900274663522" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to skip reading this blog and just go there to get delicious food here is their info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roma Foods&lt;br /&gt;9 Cobbee Rd., Latham&lt;br /&gt;tel. 785-7480&lt;br /&gt;hours: M- Th and Sat: 9-6&lt;br /&gt;Friday: 9-7&lt;br /&gt;Sunday: closed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a location in Saratoga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are a deli, there is a whole separate meats shop next door, and "deli" doesn't even begin to explain the nummyness here. (It will take a meat eater to go there and report on their salamis, but they looked really, really good. They also had things like chicken sausage and whole turkey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an entire aisle of different kinds of pastas: imported types from Italy, Farro pastas, and all different shapes and sizes. There is a frozen foods section with raviolis (plain as well as things like lobster ravioli), and spinach pies  that looked wonderful. They have those homemade Italian lemon cookies with icing. Sauces galore, both Italian and salsas (I got a bottle of mango salsa). Greek tarama and taramosalata. Relishes, every size and shape of caper you could possibly want in large or small bottles, about a dozen types of olives in their deli section (plus others in jars). There are hard-to-find baking ingredients like marzipan and chestnuts. There are chocolates, panettone, biscottis, Italian cookies (the typical American kinds that are outlandishly colored pink and green and such, in a glass case) and a whole selection of packaged taralli, those heavenly little donut-shaped Italian crackers I became obsessed with two years ago after finding them at the Italian festival in Schenectady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the anise kind (for dessert) and the fennel kind (for snacking). They are dangerously addictive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily pick up dinner there, and the prices are very reasonable. I got the chef Paul caponata, which is just bursting with big juicy capers, olives, and pine nuts. The grilled eggplant and zucchini weren't as good, but still, who's complaining-- that you can *get* these things in Latham is a major achievement. I got a large jar of Maille dijon mustard for just $3.99, and a large jar of red peppers for just $3.49. I got a gorgeous bottle of unfiltered olive oil (the real thing, with smoky green olive sedimentation) for just $16.95 for a whole liter, where that would easily cost me $35 or $40 anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who work there are efficient and friendly, and the woman behind the deli counter cut in half a big ball of fresh cow's milk (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;fior di latte&lt;/span&gt; type-- the kind in water) mozzarella* for me to take home. It's the best buffalo mozarella I've found around here. They had these intriguing antique wooden bins of salted chickpeas that are a snack I'd never seen before. They had bags of black melon seeds (also a snack). They have reassuringly large glass jars of spices (beyond cinnamon-- things like sumac) so you can get as much as you need (not like those stingy little dank pricey plastic or glass bottles at the supermarket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also do catering and parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when I left that I forgot entirely why I was out on Route 9 anyway and had to backtrack to do my errands. I'm planning on becoming a regular at Roma's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note that "buffalo mozzarella" technically means the kind made from actual buffalo milk: read the comments for more info. I often use "buffalo mozzarella" just to refer generically to "mozzarella in water" but usually the kind in the US is made from cow's milk.</content>

  <title type='text'>Ambitiously funky: Ambition in Schenectady</title>
  <content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rk8qkAHGX-I/AAAAAAAAAEk/Rr3ULtgkjy0/s1600-h/disco.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rk8qkAHGX-I/AAAAAAAAAEk/Rr3ULtgkjy0/s200/disco.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5066314903808532450" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ambitioncafe.com/"&gt;Ambition Café&lt;/a&gt; in Schenectady is disco-funky and cool, with user friendly food and hours. They even have a disco ball hanging in the center of their elongated dining area, which is also decorated by a wall of soda bottles. And while you are eating, pop-alicious songs by Janet Jackson ("My name aint 'Baby'! It's Janet. Miss Jackson if you're Nasty!"), her bro Michael, and Pat Benatar keep you feeling upbeat. (But are not too loud at all, for the disco-phobic.) I love a good vintage pop tune. Album covers decorate the walls and bar area, with an album of Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer together. I had no idea they collaborated! This valuable information is only one of the benefits of dining at Ambition Café. But you can take anyone here: your mom, boss, friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food is quality lunch fare: lots of sandwiches, a daily soup (tomato rice was yesterday's option), and a daily special, which I ordered: salmon over greens. It was tender and just perfect for a healthy lunch. My husband got the black bean burger, which I had had the last time I was there, and it is scrumptious, served on herby  focaccia style bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rk8rqwHGX_I/AAAAAAAAAEs/9eACqps3jv4/s1600-h/burg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rk8rqwHGX_I/AAAAAAAAAEs/9eACqps3jv4/s200/burg.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5066316119284277234" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Next door to the café is &lt;a href="http://www.ambitioncafe.com/sas.html"&gt;Skinny and Sweet&lt;/a&gt;, a candy and gift shop with fun cards, chocolates, and gelato. We got gelato for dessert in the café: two chocolate peanut butters. It was only 1:30 pm and WHOA!!! Talk about sugar high. But it was so good-- it had a hazelnut tinge to it. The small, pictured here, was really large to me= 3 scoops! We could have (should have) shared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rk8svwHGYAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/tbZudG73Lzw/s1600-h/gelat.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_85DYohu5h-k/Rk8svwHGYAI/AAAAAAAAAE0/tbZudG73Lzw/s200/gelat.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5066317304695250946" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is also nice about Ambition is that they have ample space in the back for people to spread out and read or work. It's a bit dark in the restaurant, but the cheeriness of the decor and friendliness of everyone makes up for that. And both times I've been there, it's been pleasantly full of people enjoying themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are located at 154 Jay Street, which is on the pedestrian walkway in downtown Schenectady. They are open M-Fri 8 am- 6 pm and until 8 pm for Proctor's events; Thursdays until 9. Saturday 10-5.</content>

  <title type='text'>Dazzlement at the Cheesecake Factory</title>
  <content type='html'>Last Thursday, my husband and I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/"&gt;Cheesecake Factory&lt;/a&gt; because it was one of the few places we knew would be 1) open late and 2) near the Borders Bookstore, which is also open late. Plus we had heard &lt;a href="http://blogs.timesunion.com/tablehopping/?p=10#more-10"&gt;the rumors &lt;/a&gt;about it and couldn't resist going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was speedy and cheerful; it was a Thursday night, around 8:30, so we didn't have to wait at all. From what I have read online, though, be prepared for quite a wait on weekends. It wasn't packed, but there were plenty of full tables there, with people having lively conversations. Can I just say how lovely it is to be in a pleasantly buzzing place around here? Too many times, I've dined out and been the only diner in a spooky restaurant readying to close at this hour. It proves that there *is* a market out there, -- a *hungry* market!!-- for mid-to-upscale, late-night dining in the Capital Region. We are ready, restaurateurs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decor of the Cheesecake Factory is a cross between the movie set of "Cleopatra" with Miami Vice. There are palm plants, hugely lofty ceilings, and these faux columns with Egyptian-goddess-like heads on them. You forget you are in Colonie; which is mostly a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't usually like to promote chain restaurants, but I will consider returning to the Cheesecake Factory when I'm in the neighborhood of Wolf Road because the food was really good, the atmosphere is lively, and it's the kind of place you can take anyone: your mom, your colleague, kids, your internet date. It's convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their menu is intimidatingly huge: you can get just about anything from hamburgers of various stripes to pizzas, fish, steak, and pasta. The food is vaguely fusion style, heavy on American fare like "fried Macaroni and cheese" (appetizer), Nachos with cheese, and meatloaf. We shared the avocado eggrolls, which come with a tamarind dipping sauce that was truly addictive. Then, I got the fish tacos, which were also quite good; my husband got Evelyn's Favorite Pasta, which was essentially pasta with pesto and lots of fresh vegetables. It was much better than anything similar we've had down the street at the Macaroni Grill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheesecakes were the least impressive part of the whole experience. Because of their name and the dozens of types of cheescake available (peanut butter, white chocolate, cookie dough... on and on) your expectations get pumped up. But I found both cheesecakes (a vanilla bean and a key lime pie) to be overly sweet and chemical tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other downer here is that the portions are HUGE!!! I mean they're really big. BUT they seem to know this, and they made it easy for both of us to go home with ample doggy bags. That one meal of fish tacos lasted me for two more days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it's hard to ignore the chirpy box-within-a-box feeling that is inevitable from a corporatized chain. Their menu is the first I've seen that actually has full-page advertisements (for things like jewelry) alongside the list of entrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the things I do like outweigh my dislike of the chain restaurant phenomenon. The Miami Vice: Cleopatra vibe is fleeting; the interior of the restaurant is mostly airy, modern, and clean feeling. You can select from a good array of salads ("Weight Management TM" meals on their menu), like a cold salmon salad served on top of mixed greens; shrimp and crab salad; and a bunch of chicken salads. This is crucial!! Everyone that I know is weight conscious, and in this day and age, a restaurant has to have healthy options.</content>
