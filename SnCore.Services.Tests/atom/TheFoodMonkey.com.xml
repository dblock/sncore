<p>Wheeler Del Torro, the owner of <a href="http://wheelersblacklabelveganicecream.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Wheeler’s Frozen Desserts Co.</a>, a Boston-Based, high-end, vegan ice cream business, will be converting his test kitchen a new full-service vegan café.</p>
<p>“I think people hear vegan and they think militants eating twigs and dirt! I love eating and I’m not going to create anything that doesn’t taste good,” said Wheeler a former carnivore. Well, my experience with vegan cafés shows that people think that because many of them <strong>ARE </strong>filled with militants eating twigs and dirt. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what he can do! I truly appreciate good vegetarian/vegan food the rare times I have come across it.</p>
<p>I believe the trick to enjoying vegan food is to try to not think of the proteins as replacements for the real thing. Faux meat does not taste like real meat, regardless of what any vegan says (though they have chicken pretty close). So if you expect the vegan protein to have the same texture as the meat, you will be dissappointed and perhaps revolted&#8211;much like the experience of picking up someone else&#8217;s drink by accident and tasting sprite when you expected coke. If you change your mindset, however, to thinking of what you&#8217;re eating as &#8220;soy texture #1&#8243; and &#8220;soy texture #2&#8243; rather than un-beef, and un-chicken, then you can really enjoy what vegan restaurants have to offer.</p>
<p>I went to the opening of Wheeler’s Frozen Desserts, and when you stopped expecting it to taste like real ice cream, it wasn&#8217;t half bad. Plus you had a bunch of flavors filled to the brim with gobs of goodness like fruit and peanut butter.</p>
<p>For the café, Wheeler has set out to create a series of quick-serve salads, soups and sandwiches at a comfortable price point to target both the lunchtime crowd in Boston and encourage “healthy slackers” to choose his location to hang out over their local coffee house.</p>
<p>The 30-seat “Wheeler’s Café &amp; Ice Cream Bar at 334 Massachusetts Ave. will be open Monday – Saturday 11:30AM – 10:00PM and Sundays: 11:30AM – 9:00PM serving lunch, snacks time goodies and hopefully serve as a loitering-friendly spot with organic teas, couches, free Wi-Fi and occasionally feature DJ’s spinning gentle jazz, house and trip-hop.</p>
<p>I look forward to giving this a try with an open mind, and you should too!</p>

<p>Boston University offers a myriad of food and wine seminars available (for pay) to the general public. Here&#8217;s one that looks particularly good:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Caviar and Vodka with Darra Goldstein</strong></p>
<p>Learn how to eat caviar without guilt—and without going broke. Join Darra Goldstein, professor of Russian at Williams College and editor-in-chief of Gastronomica, for an elegant tasting of caviar and vodka that will introduce some excellent domestic caviars that can now take the place of endangered Russian roe. Students will learn how to be connoisseurs by focusing on the tastes, textures, and production methods of various roes—each of which will be accompanied by a distinctive vodka. This class also offers a close look at the roles of vodka and caviar in Russian culture. $65</p></blockquote>

A short while ago I visited <a href="http://www.stixboston.com/" target="_blank">STIX Restaurant and Lounge in Back Bay</a> to try out (what else?) their STIX.</p>
<p>STIX are thin pieces of wood soaked in marinade such that when you skewer meat with them, they exude their flavorful bounty into whatever you are skewering from the inside out. STIX Restaurant and Lounge offers many different varieties of STIX, each designed to pair with the particular protein within which they are impaled.</p>
<p>I especially recommend the <em>Applewood Smoked Bacon on Honey Burbon STIX in Waffle Batte</em>r and the <em>Tuna Sashimi Style on Ginger Mango STIX</em> that are featured in this video.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://thefoodmonkey.com/?p=153"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center"><img title="tryptophan" src="http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en-commons/thumb/0/0a/140px-L-tryptophan-3D-sticks.png" alt="tryptophan" /></div>
<p>For many years I believed that the chemical tryptophan in a Thanksgiving turkey is what causes one to feel sleepy after the feast. But after looking into it, I&#8217;ve found out that it could all be a lie. A brutal, hurtful, malicious lie.</p>
<p>I decided to investigate.</p>
<p>The process seems to work like this: L-tryptophan is an <a title="amino acid" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid" target="_blank">amino acid</a>. It goes through some very simple and straightforward metabolic processes, <a href="http://www.biochemj.org/bj/361/0567/bj3610567a01.gif" target="_blank">which you can see here</a>. One of those processes produces 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, aka 5-HT, aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" target="_blank">serotonin</a>.</p>
<p>Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, has been known to have many effects on behavior that I&#8217;m not really going to get into, lest I get an angry letter from Tom Cruise on how I don&#8217;t <em>really </em>know the history of psychiatry. One of those effects is regulation of sleep/wake cycles. It has been this mechanism that has been suggested as the reason for post-turkey sleep, and has even led to tryptophan being used as a cure for insomnia. It was, however, <a href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/ds-tryp1.html" target="_blank">banned in the 90s</a> because some tainted tryptophan supplements caused cases of <a href="http://www.nemsn.org/" target="_blank">eosinophilia myalgia syndrome</a>, a potentially fatal disease which causes severe muscle pain, in users. It is back on the market now, though the FDA urges caution.</p>
<p>But many people report that turkey is not a sufficient source of tryptophan to actually cause sleepiness. Turkey isn&#8217;t super high in tryptophan, and tryptophan is most effective on an empty stomach (because of interactions with proteins and other amino acids), which is something you certainly don&#8217;t get on Thanksgiving. Also, dairy products like cheese are high in tryptophan, especially Cheddar, Gruyere, and Swiss and you never hear of that post fondue-stupor. These folks say a more likely reason for Thanksgiving sleepiness is the large amounts of fat, carbs, and alcohol that is consumed. The intensity of the metabolic processes just  from increased food consumption <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18063930?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank">have been shown to alter sleep/wake patterns</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, tryptophan has been shown <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/204/22/3867.pdf" target="_blank">to reduce aggression in trout</a>, and a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16053244&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" target="_blank">recent study</a> has shown that tryptophan that comes from protein can be just as effective as the pure thing. <a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/11/does-tryptophan-from-turkey-meat-make.html" target="_blank">Someone has also proposed the idea</a> that it&#8217;s not the serotonin resulting from tryptophan that causes the sleepiness, but rather the further conversion of serotonin into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin" target="_blank">melatonin </a>(another sleep regulator) that does it via the GI system. Tryptophan has even been shown to exacerbate the symptoms of psoriasis, so be careful or you could break out after dinner.</p>
<p>So I guess the jury is still out. It is clear that tryptophan can cause sleepiness, but until someone bothers to do a turkey specific study on humans it will be hard to determine what&#8217;s going on.  It&#8217;s important to know that eating most ANYTHING, especially sugary foods, will produce the serotonin effect, so perhaps it&#8217;s the simple case of correlation vs. causation, and turkey is getting a bad rap.</p>
<p>I look forward to any opinions on this from learned biochem people, for I am but a poor computational neuroscientist, and chemical reaction diagrams send cold chills up my spine.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://thefoodmonkey.com/?p=675"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="boston food blog restaurant recipes" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Habanero.jpg/300px-Habanero.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></p>
<p>Bella Luna is now featuring a new HOT and delicious dish called Chicken and Penne Arrabiata, which from the recipe, seems like a great thing to try. I think the addition of the pancetta is the most appealing part of this dish for me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Executive Chef Jacob Zachow has always been a lover of spicy food and has always wanted to issue a challenge to others to see if they can truly take the heat! “Anyone can make a dish that is painfully hot….but to make a dish that balances all the flavors in a recipe and delivers a high level of heat is truly a challenge!” A challenge that Chef Jacob feels he has met with his new Chicken and Penne Arrabiata with Honey Roasted Habanero and Fresh Parmesan. The dish is not on Bella Luna’s menu and is only available by asking for it when dining. “This dish is not for the faint of heart and I extend the challenge to any and all people who say they like spicy food to give this dish a try.” said Zachow. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe, for those of you who want to give it a shot:</p>
<div class="recipe"><strong>Chicken and Penne Arrabiata</strong><br />
Serves: 4<br />
Preparation Time: 45 Minutes</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ingredients</span></p>
<ul>
<li>2 Habanero</li>
<li>1 Medium Onion, Small Dice</li>
<li>5 Cloves of Garlic, Fine Chopped</li>
<li>¼ lb. Pancetta, Sliced Thin and Diced</li>
<li>¾ lb. Chicken Breast, Cut into 1 inch Cubes</li>
<li>2 T. Fresh Basil, Chopped</li>
<li>2 T. Italian Parsley, Chopped</li>
<li>3 T. Butter, Cubed</li>
<li>1 T. Honey</li>
<li>3 T. Olive Oil</li>
<li>¾ Cup White Wine</li>
<li>¾ Cup Chicken Stock</li>
<li>4 T. Flour</li>
<li>5 T, Fresh Parmesan, Shaved</li>
<li>¾ lb Penne Pasta, Cooked</li>
<li>Kosher Salt</li>
<li>Fresh Cracked Pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions</span></p>
<p>Step 1: Cooking Pasta and Roasting Habanero</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by filling a medium sized sauce pot ¾ of the way with water and adding 2 tablespoons of kosher salt. Place over medium high heat and bring water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8-10 minutes until pasta is al dente.</li>
<li>Next preheat your oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl add your honey and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Toss habanero in this mixture and put on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for about 15-20 Minutes or until a rich golden brown color is achieved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2: Preparing and Assembling  Ingredients</p>
<ol>
<li>Next you want to assemble all your remaining ingredients in the following order. This will help you follow the flow of preparation. First line up your butter and remaining olive oil followed by pancetta, onions, garlic, diced chicken and flour. Reserve basil and parsley for the end.</li>
<li>Next remove the stem from your roasted habanero being very careful preferably using gloves at this stage as the heat can be intense. Run habanero briefly under water rinsing away seeds, then pat dry with a paper town. Next chop habanero briefly and place next to your chicken. Wash hands thoroughly at this stage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 3: Cooking and Presentation</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by placing a large sauté pan over medium high heat. Let pan heat up for about 3 minutes. Next add butter and olive oil and wait for it to melt down. Now add pancetta, onions and garlic and let these ingredients develop color for about 8 minutes. Next add chicken, habanero and flour and continue to cook until chicken is golden brown.</li>
<li>At this stage, deglaze the pan with white wine and chicken stock. Now add the fresh basil and parsley and continue to cook until chicken is cooked and the sauce cooks down about half way. Finish by seasoning with salt and fresh cracked pepper.</li>
<li>For presentation, toss penne pasta and fresh shaved parmesan in the sauté pan. Divide pasta between four large pasta bowls and garnish with more fresh parmesan and chopped parsley.</li>
</ol>

<p>With economic times getting rough, restaurants all over the country are trying to get people in their doors however they can. Thus, the <a title="boston's best bar deals cheap eats boston" href="http://thefoodmonkey.com/bardeals/" target="_blank">Bar Menu Movement</a> is spreading beyond the puritanical, happy-hour prohibitive commonwealth of Massachusetts, and great deals are popping up everywhere.</p>
<p>USA Today recently interviewed me on the bar menu phenomenon in Boston, along with food writers and bloggers from around the country.</p>
<p>The Food Monkey&#8217;s Guide to Boston&#8217;s Best Bar Menu Deals with interactive map can be found here:<br />
<a href="http://thefoodmonkey.com/bardeals/" target="_blank">http://thefoodmonkey.com/bardeals/</a></p>
<p>From the USA Today article:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="inside-copy">Zach Brooks and Mike Prerau didn&#8217;t plan for their cheap-eats foodie blogs to evolve the way they have, but nevertheless, they&#8217;re feasting upon the troubled times in the dining industry.</div>
<p class="inside-copy">They&#8217;re among a small but growing number of bloggers in major markets who scout out dining deals in their area and alert their bargain-hungry audience. Lately they&#8217;ve been flush with material as chefs and food purveyors add lower-priced items to menus, beef up their bar snack offerings and concoct happy-hour and two-for-one specials.</p>
<p class="inside-copy">Compiling lists and reviews of cheaper restaurants has long been a sideline of mainstream foodie blogs, but sites such as Brooks&#8217; New York-based <a href="http://www.midtownlunch.com/" target="_blank">midtownlunch.com</a> and Prerau&#8217;s Boston-based    <a href="http://www.thefoodmonkey.com/" target="_blank">thefoodmonkey.com</a> present a concentrated, up-to-the-minute approach, tracking such minutiae as a change in prices at a street-food cart or additions to cocktail-hour bar menus.</p>
<p class="inside-copy">
</blockquote>
<p>You can read the entire USA Today article here:<br />
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2008-11-20-cheap-eats-blogs_N.htm" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2008-11-20-cheap-eats-blogs_N.htm</a></p>
<p>A major portion of fine dining restaurants&#8217; revenue comes from business people on expense accounts. As there are fewer businesses with the ability foot the bill for such extravagances, high end restaurants are turning to the hoi polloi to supplement their ailing coffers in this time of impending woe.</p>
<p>There is an excellent article by Mike Steinberger on Slate about how restaurants are now slashing their exorbitantly inflated wine prices, now that expense accounts are dwindling, and profit can&#8217;t come from the five $250 dollar bottles of Dom expected to be ordered at every table with a corporate credit card.</p>
<p>You can read the Slate article here:<br />
<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2203345/pagenum/all/" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/id/2203345/pagenum/all/</a></p>
<p>So, in spite of the failing economy, and in spite of the fact that agriculture is threatening to shift from the food business to the fuel business, consumers&#8211;at least for now&#8211;can expect a break.</p>
<p>Enjoy this ephemeral opportunity while it lasts!</p>
