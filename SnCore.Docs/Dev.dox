\section dev_intro Introduction
This page will guide you through the SnCore installation and development process. It's pretty easy. 

\section dev_req Prerequisites 
\li Microsoft Windows 2000, 2003 or XP. 
\li Microsoft SQL Server 2000
\li Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0

\li Microsoft IIS running ASP.NET 2.0
\li Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

\section dev_source Source Code
<ol>
 <li>Download and install a Perforce client from http://www.perforce.com/.
 <li>From command line set the <em>P4CONFIG</em> variable. This will let you easily connect to multiple Perforce depots and
     manage branches and client views.
\code
p4 set P4CONFIG=p4.ini
\endcode
 <li>Create a new directory, eg. C:\\SnCore.
 <li>The account used to access perforce is <em>guest</em>, because Perforce licenses are $800 a pop. It has <em>open</em>
     permissions, which means that you can checkout files and modify them, but cannot check-in. Please coordonate
     code reviews with dB.
 <li>Create a <b>p4.ini</b> file in this directory with the following contents. Replace parts of <em>P4CLIENT</em> with
     values that help identify who you are (your username and machine name).
\code
P4PORT=perforce.vestris.com:6666
P4USER=guest
P4CLIENT=SnCore-yourname-main-yourmachinename-1
\endcode
 <li>Run <em>p4 login</em>. The password for the user <em>guest</em> is <em>guest</em>.
 <li>Run <em>p4 client</em> and enter the following client view. Save the file and exit the editor. It should report
     that your client was successfully created.
\code
    //depot/sncore/main/... //sncore-yourname-main-yourmachinename-1/...
\endcode
 <li>Run <em>p4 sync</em>. This will bring the files to your machine.
</ol>

\section dev_howto Installation

Follow the normal \ref install. Visual Studio will create the websites for you, so you can skip that step.
