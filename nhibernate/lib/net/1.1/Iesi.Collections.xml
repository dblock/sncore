            <summary>
            <p><c>DictionarySet</c> is an abstract class that supports the creation of new <c>Set</c>
            types where the underlying data store is an <c>IDictionary</c> instance.</p> 
             
            <p>You can use any object that implements the <c>IDictionary</c> interface to hold set data.
            You can define your own, or you can use one of the objects provided in the Framework.   
            The type of <c>IDictionary</c> you choose will affect both the performance and the behavior
            of the <c>Set</c> using it. </p>
            
            <p>To make a <c>Set</c> typed based on your own <c>IDictionary</c>, simply derive a
            new class with a constructor that takes no parameters.  Some <c>Set</c> implmentations
            cannot be defined with a default constructor.  If this is the case for your class, 
            you will need to override <c>Clone()</c> as well.</p>
            
            <p>It is also standard practice that at least one of your constructors takes an <c>ICollection</c> or 
            an <c>ISet</c> as an argument.</p>

            			The System.Collections namespace in the .NET Framework provides a number of collection 
            			types that are extremely useful for manipulating data in memory. However, there is one 
            			type of collection that is conspicuously missing from <c>System.Collections</c>: the 
            			<c>Set</c>.
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			A <c>Set</c> is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and where the order of
            			the elements may be arbitrary. It is loosely modelled after 
            			the mathematical concept of a "set." This implementation is based on the Java <c>Set</c> 
            			interface definition, so if you are also a Java programmer, this may seem familiar. 
            			This library provides a number of "standard" <c>Set</c> operators that the Java library 
            			neglected to include.
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			<c>Sets</c> come in handy when an <c>Array</c> or a <c>List</c> won't quite fit the bill. 
            			Arrays in .NET have a fixed length, making it tedious to add and remove elements. 
            			Lists allow you add new objects easily, but you can have numerous duplicate 
            			elements, which is undesirable for some types of problems. 
            			Searching Arrays or Lists for elements is just plain slow for large data sets, 
            			requiring a linear search. You could keep the array sorted and use a binary search, 
            			but that is often more trouble than it is worth (especially since this library, 
            			and the .NET Framework, provide better ways that are already written for you).
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			With sets, adding elements, removing elements, and checking for the existence 
            			of an element is fast and simple. You can mix and match the elements in different 
            			sets using the supported mathematical set operators: union, intersection, 
            			exclusive-or, and minus. 
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			You will see some interesting side effects with different <c>Set</c> 
            			implementations in this library, depending on the underlying search algorithm. 
            			For example, if you choose a sort-based <c>Set</c>, the elements will come out 
            			in sort order when you iterate using <c>foreach</c>. If you use a hash-based 
            			<c>Set</c>, the elements will come out in no particular order, but checking 
            			for inclusion will fastest when dealing with large data sets. If you use a 
            			list-based <c>Set</c>, elements will come out in the order you put them in 
            			when you iterate (although the effect of operators on element order in 
            			<c>Set</c> instances is not well defined by design). Additionally, list-based 
            			sets are fastest for very small data sets (up to about 10 elements), 
            			but get slower very quickly as the number of contained elements increases. 
            			To get the best of both worlds, the library provides a <c>Set</c> type that 
            			uses lists for small data sets and switches to a hash-based algorithm when 
            			the data set gets large enough to warrant it.
            		</p>
