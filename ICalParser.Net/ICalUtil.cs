         * From RFC2445
         * 
         * Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
         * break. Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
         * representations using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long
         * line can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF
         * immediately followed by a single linear white space character (i.e.,
         * SPACE, US-ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9). Any sequence
         * of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear white space character
         * is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content type.
         * 
         * For example the line:
         * 
         *   DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.
         * 
         * Can be represented as:
         * 
         *   DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
         *    ng description
         *    that exists on a long line.
