		<h1>Welcome to NHibernateContrib.</h1>

		<hr>

		<p>
			The NHibernateContrib is various programs contributed to <a title="NHibernate web-site" href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a> by members of the NHibernate team or by the end users.  The projects in here are not considered core pieces of NHibernate but they extend it in a useful way.
		</p>

		<p>
			The current projects are:
		</p>

		<ul>

			<li>

				Nullables: A library of Nullable version of the ValueTypes in net-1.1.  It is meant to serve as 

				a bridge until .net-2.0 comes out with their own Nullables.

			</li>

			<li>

				Nullables.NHibernate:  A library of NHibernate Types for the Nullables.

			</li>

			<li>

				Nullables.Tests:  A library of NUnit Tests for Nullables and Nullables.NHibernate.

			</li>

			<li>

				BantamTech.SysCache:  A pluggable cache provider for NHibernate which leverages the ASP.NET Cache object.

			</li>

		</ul>

		

		

		</li>

		<h2>Latest Version</h2>

		<p>

			Details of the latest version of NHibernateContrib can be found on SourceForge at 

			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate</a>.

		</p>

		<h2>Documentation</h2>

		<p>

			The API of the components in NHibernateContrib is in MSDN format thanks to 

			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndoc">NDoc</a>.

		</p>

		<P>

			The help can also be integrated into Visual Studio.NET using the following steps.

		</P>

		<ul>

			<li>

				Download and install H2Reg from <a href="http://helpware.net/mshelp2/h2reg.htm">http://helpware.net/mshelp2/h2reg.htm</a>

			</li>

			<li>

				Register the NHibernate help collection before registering NHibernateContrib 

				help. The NHibernateContrib help is registered as a plug-in to the NHibernate 

				help, so if this is not installed first, NHibernateContrib help will not be 

				accessible.

			</li>

			<li>

				Copy H2Reg.exe and H2Reg.ini from the H2Reg installation folder (typically C:\Program Files\HelpWare\H2Reg) to

				the NHibernateContrib sdk folder (e.g. C:\NHibernateContrib\doc\sdk).

			</li>

			<li>

				Register the help collection from the command line using the following command from the NHibernate sdk folder.

			</li>

		</ul>

		<blockquote>

			<code>

				H2Reg -r CmdFile=NHibernateContrib.ini

			</code>

		</blockquote>

		<ul>

			<li>

				If you need to unregister the help collection, the command is as follows:

			</li>

		</ul>

		<blockquote>

			<code>

				H2Reg -u CmdFile=NHibernateContrib.ini

			</code>

		</blockquote>
