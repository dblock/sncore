     What's a foodie?
    </p>
    <p>
     This definition is from foodies.com.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>"On the curriculum vitae of a foodie, "eating" is listed as a hobby. The foodie lives to eat, and to eat to 
     live is definitive boredom. A true foodie clings to all things culinary."</em></p>
    <p>
     But basically, if you like food, this is for you.

     How is FoodCandy different from _____ ?</p>
    <ol>
    <li>FoodCandy is very social like Friendster, MySpace or Yelp, but there're no music
     bands or dentists here.</li><li>FoodCandy is conversational like eGullet or Chowhound, but it doesn't take itselt
      as seriously. FoodCandy discussions are also in rich full color with pictures and
      videos if you like.</li><li>FoodCandy syndicates food blogs like FoodPornWatch, but with full content, virtually
      intact original layout and a creative license of your choosing. Then, like no other system FoodCandy extracts pictures from hundreds of syndicated blogs to create the
      ultimate food porn.</li><li>FoodCandy lists restaurants like CitySearch or MenuPages, but does not attempt
      to be a complete reference. Instead of ratings, it encourages real human experiences
      expressed with words and photos.</li><li>FoodCandy lets users talk about cooking and recipes, but it is not yet another
       recipe site.</li>
     <li>FoodCandy publishes a member-only free monthly newsletter, but it is produced by amateurs
      with a unique unpretentious voice.</li></ol>

     Who are you?
    </p>
    <p>
     My name is <b>dB.</b> I am a computer geek and I eat three times a day.
    </p>
    <p>
     I used to read many food publications. I starved for food reviews in Time Out Magazine and salivated over recipes in 
     Food and Wine. Then, I hungrily consumed hundreds of wonderful food blogs from amateur and professional chefs. 
     I gazed every personal review and experience about a new venue in New York city and jealously wished I had been 
     first to write about it. I sought advise on public food groups and forums when it came to such serious decisions as what knife to buy.
     And I was joined by many good friends and we ate and talked.
     <br /><br />
     But it wasn't enough ...
     <br /><br />
     One day, I was hungry and tried to eat my computer. I didn't taste very good and so I decided to create FoodCandy.
