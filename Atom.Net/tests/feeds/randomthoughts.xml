Cut and paste from the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python">twisted-python</a> mailing
list (Philip J Eby) slightly edited for my own reference:
<blockquote>
Here's a simpler version of the instructions:
<ol>
<li> Get your machine set up to build extensions using the distutils</li>
<li> Download the python package and run 'setup.py install'</li>

</ol>
Step 1 is a bit more complex than step 2, but is worth the trouble because it means you can build any Python extension for Windows without the author needing to produce a binary package for you.  It amounts to:
<ol type="A">
<li> Install MinGW or Cygwin.  I personally prefer Cygwin because there aren't so many things to install.  Just pop over to <a href="http://cygwin.com" title="cygwin.com">cygwin.com</a>, click "install now", and be sure to include the GCC compiler when you're asked what packages you want.  (DON'T install the Cygwin Python, btw, unless you have a good reason.  You don't need it if you're building extensions for Windows Python.)  Anyway, when you're done with the Cygwin install, you'll have a nice icon that opens up a Cygwin shell, which is a convenient prompt to run things from.</li>

<li> ensure that the MinGW or Cygwin tools are on your system path.  E.g. add 'C:\cygwin\bin' to your PATH.</li>

<li> add a distutils.cfg file to your C:\Python2x\Lib\distutils directory, containing the lines:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
[build]
compiler=mingw32
</pre>
this will make GCC your default compiler for any C extensions you build in future, so you won't need to do any of that '-c mingw32' junk.

Once you've done this, you can happily run 'python setup.py install' to install C extensions.

I'm a fan of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a> to make sure my
services are running and running and running... well, you get the idea. So a two second
tip to get your <a href="http://roundup.sf.net">roundup</a> tracker running reliably under
daemontools. Firstly, you need daemontools installed:
</p>
<pre>
$emerge daemontools
</pre>
<p>
Your milage will vary depending on your linux distribution of course :)
</p>
<p>
Now I created (as root) my service directory:
</p>
<pre>
$mkdir /etc/roundup-qa
</pre>
<p>
Create your <em>run</em> file in /etc/roundup-qa:
</p>
<pre>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
exec 2&gt;&amp;1
exec setgiduid your-roundup-user roundup-server -p 8090 /opt/roundup/trackers/qa
</pre></pre>
<p>
Create log directories and chown it to your-roundup-user:
</p>
<pre>
$mkdir /etc/roundup-qa/log
$mkdir /etc/roundup-qa/log/main
$chown your-roundup-user /etc/roundup-qa/log/main
</pre>
<p>Create your <em>run</em> file for the log:</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
exec setgiduid your-roundup-user multilog t ./main
</pre>
<p>Link the service directory so daemontools knows to run our service:</p>
<pre>
$ln -s /etc/roundup-qa /service/roundup-qa
</pre>
<p>Start svscan:</p>
<pre>
$/etc/init.d/svscan start
</pre>
<p>Again depending on linux distribution your milage may vary on that command. Wait up to 5 seconds
and your tracker will run and run and run....</p>
<p>
If you want to stop your tracker:</p>
<pre>
$svc -d /service/roundup-qa
</pre>
<p>Start your tracker</p>
<pre>
$svc -u /service/roundup-qa
</pre>

In a prior
<em>
<a href="http://randomthoughts.vandorp.ca/syncato/WK/blog/744?t=item" title="A gentle introduction to the roundup API">
article</a>
</em>
(and I use the term article loosely) I described briefly how you can connect to roundup and start to
perform interactive queries against the tracker outside of the web, command-line, and email interfaces. Upon re-reading
it myself, I noticed there are a few things that should be pointed out.
</p>
<p>
First off, when accessing roundup there is what we call a
<em>
global lock
</em>.
What this means is, once a connection
is made to the tracker, no other connections are allowed until the first connection is finished. In practical terms, once
you establish a connection interactively the web, command-line, and email interfaces will no longer respond. So, any
scripts which access roundup should try and get their work done and exit as quickly as they can.
</p>
<pre>
>>>from roundup import instance
>>>tracker = instance.open('/my/tracker/location')
>>>db = tracker.open('someuser')
>>>#perform some stuff here
>>>db.close()  #close the connection
</pre>
<p>
I also had some statments like
<pre>
>>>issues = db.issue.list()
</pre>
By way of explanation, what we are basically doing is:
<pre>
db.classname.list()
</pre>
And
<em>classname</em>
 can be any of the classes in the tracker. I guess the next logical question is, what classes
are in the tracker? Easy, if you have admin permissions in the tracker by default you have menu item in the web interface
which displays all the classes. Since we talking python and scripting, there's an API function:
<pre>
>>>db.getclasses()
['file', 'issue', 'keyword', 'msg', 'priority', 'query', 'status', 'user']
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Oh and an API function that I'll touch on briefy is <em>filter()</em>:
<pre>
>>>startdate = '2004-01-01'
>>>enddate   = '2004-01-31'
>>>matches = db.issue.filter(None,{'creation':'from' +startdate+ 'to' +enddate})
>>>matches
['24', '25', '26', '27']
</pre>
So what magic is this? Well, basically the <em>matches</em> variable contains a list of
issues that were created between <em>startdate</em> and <em>enddate</em>. Cool eh?
</p>
<p>
I think that I've gone over enough of roundup's API functions to illustrate that we can do
all sorts of powerfull things including searching. There are more API functions that
can be found in the <a href="http://roundup.sourceforge.net/apidocs/roundup">online API documentation</a> which can be
a fine resource if your into reading those sorts of things.
</p>
<p>
I guess the next step is put all we've gone over
into some sort of useful script. Sounds like a task for another day...
