<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the local .NET UserGroup the founder of <a href="http://www.agilemovement.it">AgileMovement.it</a> asked what's the general opinion about .NET2.0 partial types, so I've posted mine, but since the post is in italian I'm going to translate it in english for my blog:
<br />
<br />IMHO partial classes have to be taken with the dropper (and with the magnifying glass too...). I'm not agree when they are defined a "revolution" because in my opinion are a "workaround" to the problems of code generators (or useful in those contexts). Let's the scenarios:
<br />
<br />- cvs: nowadays there are problems to handle cvs with a team who work on the same class, problems that IMHO wouldn't be solved with partial types because if (as the good Murphy teachs us) something could go wrong, it will with partial types too, I explain myself: suppose that John and I are working on the same class (I keep on asking myself why someone else and I should work on the same class but ignore it and go on...); if something goes working the integrity of a single file is underminded, that thing doubles (or worse) with partial types. After all it's not a big problem... ;)
<br />
<br />- inheritance and OOP: maybe I'm a traditionalist but I don't see how partial types could fit (here in the italian version there's a pun but it's impossible to translate it) in the OOP architecture... inheritance? No because I don't inherit, code reuse? No because there's no need to play Lego with a software... admit that I've mis-intepreted the big plan behind partial types and that they are a revolution... revolution of what? To avoid using <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FacadePattern">Façade</a>? Mmm IMHO the problem has to be resolved at the root (that's what I meant with "workaround" at the beginning of the post)
<br />
<br />- code generators: likely the only purpose of this "revolution", maybe tools like LLBGen, datalayers generators or something else could benefit :)
<br />
<br />- <acronym title="Visual Studio .NET">VS.NET</acronym>, WindowsForms and other stuff: in my opinion with this point of view are more than an error because they step over things like MVC and so on; I didn't see how <acronym title="Visual Studio">VS</acronym> generates the code with partial types but I have the idea that we could end with "meltin pot" partial types to throw in all the source code that a developer should not see. Much better approaches like XUL, Glade, XAML (if my mind don't play tricks on me they use partial types under the hood, but they don't expose them to classes users) and so on.
<br />
<br />So... partial types? Yes but the lesser the better. I'm in favour for XAML and for code generators, a little less for Windows Forms and to the direct exposure to programmers.

<content type="text/html" mode="escaped">
	&lt;p&gt;I have been asked recently whether we should fork the C#
	language and add extensions and improvements to the language
	and the class libraries to deviate from Microsoft (there are
	plenty of little small things that can be done with relatively
	no effort).

	&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that making the Mono C# compiler
	incompatible with the Microsoft and the ECMA standard is a
	good idea.  A big benefit of having a compatible language is
	that source code can be interchanged between the two platforms
	with ease.  If we were to modify the language to have features
	not found in the Microsoft compiler, we would make the life of
	our end users (software developers) harder for no good reason.

	&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I would encourage folks to prototype
	their ideas on the compiler: if your idea is great, we could
	help drafting a proposal and bring that forward to ECMA and
	Microsoft, and who knows, it could even become part of the
	standard. 

&lt;h3&gt;Nullable types&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I personally did not like the C# language support for
	nullable types I felt they had no place in the language, and I
	think a lot of people feel the same way.

	&lt;p&gt;I changed my opinion on its usefulness when I explained
	them to a couple of friends: they immediately saw the benefits
	to them.  It was clear that my programmer background was not
	the same programmer background that nullable types addressed.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In those days I was trying to enhance parsing capabilities of Atom .NET and since I based all the API around XPath I tried to gain more advantages from .NET implementation. The only limit I recognized is the lack of the capability to "serialize" the content of a visiting node (something like InnerXml or OuterXml properties in the DOM classes or ReadInnerXml(), ReadOuterXml() in the pull parser classes). So I asked around and <a href="http://www.tkachenko.com/blog/">Oleg Tkachenko</a> (MS MVP) pointed me out the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mvp-xml">MVP-Xml</a> library, a MVP's collaborative project to enhance XML support in .NET.

	&lt;p&gt;A good friend was asking me about why I had abandoned
	CORBA (I did not).  Here is my response:

	&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;On the CORBA question: I have not particularly abandoned
	the idea of CORBA.  It was just that CORBA as a platform to
	solve the multi-lingual issue was too hard (too huge of an
	investment, steep learning curve).  In fact, I would like to
	use more of IIOP as a replacement for remoting and web
	services in key places.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I think that *some* elements of CORBA are extremely useful
	and are better than many of the Microsoft proposed
	APIs/protocols, but the problem with CORBA is that you must
	move carefully: it is too easy to get trapped in that world of
	standards and try to implement and use everything.

	&lt;p&gt;Some bits of CORBA are extraordinary, but teaching it is
	hard given the large scope of it: what pieces of it must be
	ignored and what pieces are followed is a tricky part.

	&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I think the Next Generation Web Services (WS-*) world has
	reached the same level of complexity that CORBA achieved in
	an effort to satisfy the users requests.  It seems that WS-*
	is a victim of its own success: once SOAP web services could
	be produced and consumed easily with `netcat', but today,
	realistically to integrate with any of the advanced features
	you need a stack as complete and as complex as the various
	CORBA implementations.

	&lt;p&gt;Web Services were pushed in the same direction that CORBA
	was used, and it started to get used in places where CORBA was
	used, and they ended up with pretty much the same thing CORBA
	had, and sadly without some of the benefits of it.   Not a
	particularly fascinating subject.

	&lt;p&gt;Speaking of fascinating technologies, a few ex-CORBA people
	went to create a new RPC stack with a very precise set of
	features at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroc.com&quot;&gt;ZeroC&lt;/a&gt;.  It is
	called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html&quot;&gt;Ice&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;I first heard about Ice from Vladimir, who wrote his own
	implementation of the protocol in C#.  It is available from
	the Mono CVS repository, and is a subset the features offered
	by ZeroC's product.  ZeroC's product is dual licensed: GPL and
	Commercial and today they support Java and PHP with a C#
	version in the works.
